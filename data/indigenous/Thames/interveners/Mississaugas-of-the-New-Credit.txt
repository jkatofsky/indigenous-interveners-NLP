INTRODUCTION  
1.This appeal  is the first opportunity for this Court to consider the Crown’s duty to consult in
the context of the unique pre -Confederation treaties and outstanding First Nation claims that
span much of southern Ontario.  It also provides the first opportunity for this  Court to
consider the confusion created by section  58 of the National Energy Board Act  (the “ NEB
Act”) in relation to the operation of the Crown’s duty to consult in First Nation territories.
2.The Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (“MNCFN ”) intervenes in support of the
Appellant in this appeal.  It seek s a reso lution of this important Crown consultation case that
will ensure that reconciliation  begin s—finally —to penetrate  its traditional home and
territory , a territory  crisscrossed  by pre -existing pipelines, a territory that is now one of the
most densely populated and industrialized regions in all of North America —Ontario’s
“golden horseshoe.”  The stakes in this appeal for MNCFN and the Appellant  could not be
higher . If allowed to stand, the majority below’s decision would maintain the status quo and
enable pipeline companies such as  Enbridge to continue with “business as usual,”
disregarding  the unique claims, interests , and ambitions of these First Nations.  The promise
of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982  would largely be rendered meaningless to
southern Ontario First Nations.  This cannot be in the age of reconciliation .
PART I – STATEMENT OF FACTS  
3.MNCFN  adopts the Appellant’s facts and adds  that MNCFN  is a Band under the Indian Act
comprised of the descendants of the Mississauga people whose traditional territory extend s
across much of southern Ontario  and encompasses present day Kitchener, Niagara Falls,
Hamilton, and Toronto, including MNCFN’s reserve lands near Hagersville.
4.MNCFN has a unique, ongoing, and incomplete treaty relationship with the Crown.  Between
1781 and 1823, the ancestors of MNCFN entered into a number of different treaties with the
Crown that variously reserved lands, waters, and fisheries for MNCFN’s exclusive us e.1

8. 
15.Enbridge’s Line 9 pipeline is one of several pipelines that transect MNCFN’s traditional
territory. MNCFN was one of the four First Nations that were granted intervener status in the
Line 9B hearing before the National Energy Board (“NEB”),2 and filed  evidence and final
argument outlining, inter alia , concerns about the lack of Crown consultation on the project’s
adverse impacts on its Aboriginal rights and treaty rights.3
PART II – ISSUE S ON APPEAL  
6.MNCFN interve nes in support of the Appellant  and makes submissions on the following :
a.Reconciliation, the duty to consult , and the resolution of this appeal ;
b.Southern Ontario cannot be allowed to become a “Crown consultation free zone ”;
c.The importance of a preliminary assessment  in ensuring meaningfu l consultation ;
d.Consultation cannot be a guessing game , achieved by happenstance ; and
e.An ex post facto  declaratory remedy is inadequate .
PART III – ARGUMENT  
A.Reconciliation , the Duty to Consult , and the Resolution of this Appeal
7.This Court has held that “[t]he fundamental objective of the modern law of aboriginal and
treaty rights is the reconciliation of aboriginal peoples and non -aboriginal peoples  and their
respective claims, interests and ambitions .”4 Real reconciliation  requires a renewed , diffi cult, 
and meaningful conversation about how these sometimes differing  “claims, interests and 
ambitions ” can be collectively advanced in the 21st Century and beyond.5 The Crown’s duty 
to consult is a key legal  tool that helps initiate  and guide  this long overdue conversation.  But 
in order for ho nourable consultation —and meaningful conversation —to be had , the Crown

2must actually be aware of , appreciate , and engage with respect to, the claims, interests , and 
ambitions of an impacted First Nation  prior to authorizing an industrial development . That 
did not happen  in this case. 
8.Reconciliation fo r these First Nations  needs to occur in, and with an understanding of, the
territor ies these nations  now have.  Their territories are among  the most densely populated
areas in North America , crisscrossed  by multi -lane highways and pipelines.  Their treaty
harvesting rights  and traditional practices in southwestern Ontario have long been impaired
and constrained to make way for the influx of settlers, industrial developments , and rampant
urbanization. For First Nations in southern Canada generally , and southern  Ontario
speci fically, reconciliation will not be achieved by only measuring, quantifying , and
potentially compensating for loss of site -specific traditional land use activities, as the NEB
did here.6
9.True consultation —and reconciliation —requires a conversation about h ow these First
Nations can continue to “use and be sustained”7 by their territories, as they actually exist
today.  McLachlin J. (as she was then), recognized that treaties, including the pre -
Confederation treaties engaged in this appeal, must be understood  as arrangements that:
…bear testimony to the acceptance by the colonizers of the principle that the aboriginal 
peoples who occupied what is now Canada were regarded as possessing the aboriginal 
right to live off their lands and the resources found in their forests and streams to the  
extent they had traditionally done so.  The fundamental understanding —the Grundnorm  
of settlement in Canada —was that the aboriginal people could only be deprived of the 
sustenance they traditionally drew from the land and adjacent waters by solemn treaty 
with the Crown, on terms that would ensure to them and to their successors a 
replacement for the livelihood  that their lands, forests and streams had since ancestral 
times provided them.8  
10.A regulatory “engagement” process  that limits an assessment of  Aboriginal “rights and
interests” to those understood through the lens of traditional land use is entirely inadequate .

I, Tab 2 at para. 17.

8Van der Peet,  MBoA Vol I, Tab 7 at para. 272 (McLachlin J. dissenting on other grounds) (emphasis 
added).  
3The NEB process at issue in this appeal utterly failed as a mechanism to appreciate and 
reconcile the “rights, interests and ambitions” o f these First Nation s whose traditional 
territories are no longer untouched and pristine wilderness.  In particular, the NEB process 
preclude d any discussion about “replacement for the livelihood ” that have long been lost or 
are being eroded . First Nation  requests  to consult on the  intent of their treaties and  the 
achievement of their  ambitions through  economic participation fell on deaf ears.9 The 
impacts from the stress of additional risk being placed on their territories were ignored.  They 
continue to be seen as mere stakeholders in the territories, rather than stewards.  In effect, 
these First Nations  are left in the same position they were in when Line 9 was originally 
constructed in 1975 —a time before  section 35 of the Constitution  Act, 1982  and before  this 
Court’s judicial guidance on consultation and reconciliation . It is déjà vu all over again.  
11.This context must inform the Court’s resolution of this appeal. This is not simply a case
about a legi slative peculiarity created by section  58 of the NEB Act . It is a case about whether
and how reconciliation  will finally begin to penetrate southern Ontario.
B.Southern Ontario Cannot Be Allowed to Become a “Crown Consul tation Free
Zone”  … Again
12.MNCFN’s traditional territory —much like  the Appellant ’s—is crisscrossed with pipelines,
including not only Line 9, but also Enbridge’s Lines 7, 8, 10, and 11, among others.  The
Respondents acknowledge that there was no consultation with First Nations during the 1970s
when this extensive pipeline network was bu ilt in southern Ontario. Since 2011, Enbridge
has filed no less than six applications for orders pursuant to section  58 related to various
pipelines in MNCFN’s territory.10 And it does not stop with Enbridge. The NEB recently
approved other pipeline project s in MNCFN’s territory pursuant to section  58 and it is

4considering still more applications. And yet genuine Crown consultation on these projects (as 
can be seen in this appeal) remains  all but non -existent .  
13.The majority at the Court of Appeal was wrong when it concluded that the NEB can issue
authorizations under section  58 even if it has been advised that Crown consultation has not
occurred, as was the case here.11 To do so  contradicts this Court’s express di rections in
Haida Nation , Carrier Sekani , and Little Salmon/Carmacks that the duty requires proactive
and upstream Crown consultation prior to  a decision being made.12 The majority below’s
interpretation of section  58 could effectively allow the creation of  a “Crown consultation -free
zone” with respect to much of the significant pipeline redevelopment happening around the
country, particularly in southern Ontario.
14.The majority below’s reasoning would mean that, for  First Nations such as  MNCFN, the
pipelines  that were built in their territories in the mid 20th Century —without any consultation
and without any accommodation of their rights, interests, and claims —can today be re -
purposed, redeveloped, and expanded without any meaningful Crown consultation.13 In
effect, Crown consultation can be repeatedly evaded by discrete, proponent -driven
applications under  section 58.  This approach allows the massive pipeline redevelopment that
is ongoing in southwestern Ontario to avoid  triggering any strategic level Crown consultation
with First Nations.

15. Such an interpretation of section  58 essentially renders this Court’s decisions in Haida 
Nation  and Mikisew Cree  without application  to the massive  pipeline  redevelopment  that is 
ongoing in MNCFN’s traditional territory.  As seen in this appeal, the much needed 
conversation about the claims, interests , and ambitions of these First Nation s never happens. 
The promise of section 35  of the Constitution Act, 1982 is denied and the lack of Crown 
consultation that plagued the past can be —and is— repeated.  
C. The Importance of a  Preliminar y Assessment  in Ensuring  Meaningful  
Consultation  
 
16. This appeal highlights the importance of this Court’s direction in Haida Nation  with respec t 
to the need for some form of  “preliminary assessment” by the Crown of the potentially 
impacted rights, interests , and claims of First Nations  in order to properly determine the 
scope of consultations required.14 This type of assessment is essential to the proper discharge 
of the duty because it frames the discussions and issues that must  form part of a meaningful 
consultation  process . This preliminary assessment  ensures  the parties understand each other’s 
positions and a conversation can be had. Without this type of assessment, reconci liation can 
never begin.  
17. Moreover, i n the context of historic treaties (such as the ones at issue in this appeal), this 
Court has held that “[t]he determination of the content of the duty to consult will, as Haida  
Nation  suggests, be governed by the context.”15 Mikisew Cree  identified various factors that 
must be considered in determining the scope of the Crown’s duty, including “[t]he history of 
dealings between the Crown and a particular First Nation.”16 In this appeal , the NEB ’s 
Reasons for Decision includes  no appreciation of this history, the different treaties at issue in 
this appeal nor, the distinct First Nation rights and interests that flow from those  agreements. 
The NEB  had no knowledge of the state of the various  filed, ongoing , or settled land claims 
that may be relevant to Line 9 (nor any means to obtain this information from the Crown). 
The NEB  also failed to consider that First Nations in heavily urbanized and industrialized

16  Mikisew Cree, MBoA Vol I, Tab 6 at para. 63.  
6areas have been forced to develop a daptive and complex relationships to their territories, 
which often demand the use of private lands.17 
18.The unique and unfinished history of treaty -making in southern Ontario, the dispossession of
First Nations from their territories in what is now known as Ontario’s “golden horseshoe,”
the lack of any consultation on past pipeline development, and the unique reconciliatory
interests and ambitions of southern Ontario First Nations were all  necessary “context” for
understanding the scope of the Crown’s duty in this appeal. Neither the NEB nor the Crown
(as acknowledged in their submissions in this appeal) conside red any of this context in
assessing the scope or content of the duty. This constituted an error in law in the
determinations under  the first stage of the Haida Nation  framework, which should not now
be determined or assessed by this Court because all of t he necessary evidence is not before it.
D. Consultation Cannot be a Guessing Game or Occur by Happenstance
19.In order for meaningful consultation to occur, First Nations cannot be left to simply guess
with whom and where they should raise their claims, interests , and ambitions.  Mass
confusion over who is ultimately responsible and accountable for consultation does not
uphold the honour of the Crown or advance reconciliation . But that is the result the myriad of
approaches advanced by the majority below a nd the various Respondents would lead  to.
20.It is telling that the Respondents cannot even agree among themselves —or with the Court of
Appeal —whether the NEB was empowered to fulfill the duty to consult owed in this appeal ,
and if it was, to what extent.  Enbridge is adamant  that “Parliament has impliedly assigned to
the Board the power to carry out consultation when it is exercising its jurisdiction under
section 58 of the NEB Act.”18 Canada disagrees, asserting  that although “[t]he  Crown’s duty
to consult was triggered by the Board’s consideration of whether to approve” Line 9, “the
Crown [was] not delegating its duty” to the NEB.19 The majority below shares Canada’s
view, holding  “there has been no delegation by the Crown to the Boa rd, under the NEB Act
or otherwise, of the power to undertake the fulfillment of any applicable Haida  duty of the
17AR Vol I, Tab 1, pp. 111, 114 -115, NEB  Reasons for Decision  OH-002-2013 (Enbridge Pipelines Inc) (16

19Factum  of the Respondent, Attorney General of Canada [ Canada Factum ] at paras. 1 & 2.  
7Crown in relation to the Project.”20 The NEB appears to take the position that  the duty could 
be anywhere, and “it is essential to look at the substance of what has been done by any actor  
who has the power to meaningful ly consult and provide relevant accommodatio n ...”21  
21.While the Respondents  and the majority below cannot agree where consultation lies, they are
optimistic that it must lie somewhere. The Court of Appeal observes  that “the Board’s
section 58 application process may very well deal with, and hopefully remediate if necessary,
the same Aboriginal concerns that arise when the Crown engages in Haida  duty
consultations.”22 Canada ech oes the majority’s optimism, explaining  that the NEB “does not
have the statutory power to discharge the Crown’s duty to consult, although it is aware that
the Crown may rely on the Board’s section 35 Aboriginal consultation as discharging the
Crown’s duty  to consult.”23 Canada hopes the  NEB’s engagement will be adequate but notes
the Crown may “involve itself if there are issues of consultation and possible accommodation
arising in a Board proceeding that are beyond jurisdiction to address.”24 When or how th e
Crown might elect to engage when consultation issues arise beyond the  NEB ’s jurisdiction is
left for First Nations  to guess.
22.If, after a project approval,  the proponent, Canada in right of the Crown , the NEB , and the
Court of Appeal cannot even agree abo ut where the duty to consult lies  and what it requires ,
how can a First Nation have comfort meaningful consultation actually occurred ? The
divergent perspectives of the  respondents demonstrates that  additional guidance from this
Court is required . Lack of clarity on this issue frustrates the day -to-day operation of the duty.
A First Nation  cannot  be left guessing where , and by whom,  their rights and interests will be
address ed.25 While they may not ultimately agree with the outcome , MNCFN submits that
First Nations are at least owed  clarity on who is accountable . The current situation  is
tantamount t o a game of consultation “three -card Monte ,” forcing First Nations  to constantly

8guess where the consultation card is hidden today.  This is not simply an issue of  form over 
substance.  With limited capacity  and tight timelines in project approval processes, First 
Nations must know where consultation is actually going to be dealt with so they can focus 
their efforts there.  If First Nations  do not even know where to g o to consult, the difficult 
work of reconciliation cannot ever be started, let alone be advanced.  
E.An Ex Post Facto Declaratory Remedy is Inadequate
23.For the duty to consult and accommodate to be effective and meaningful, adequate remedies
must be afforded to Aboriginal peoples when the duty is breached or ignored , and to
discourage breaches from occurring in the first place . The approach proposed by the Court of
Appeal fails to do that. The maj ority below holds  that if a First Nation is  denied adeq uate
consultation or accommodation by the Crown in respect of a development being reviewed by
the NEB  under section  58, the authorization  should issue , the development should proceed,
and the Aboriginal people  should simply seek recourse to the cour ts, by way of judicial
review against the Crown.  Relying on such an “after -the-fact” approach to remediating a
breach of the duty to consult is grossly inadequate, impoverishes the scope and meaning of
the duty, and renders First Nations unable to avail themselve s of the sort of substantive
accommodations and reconciliation that Crown consultation is intended to facilitate. It may
also leave Aboriginal groups  with no meaningful judicial remedy at all.
24.The majority below states that a First Nation denied Crown cons ultation should bring “an
application for judicial review…with respect to that refusal” and through that judicial review
avail itself of “the panoply of potential available judicial remedies [that] was described by the
Supreme Court at paragraph 37 of Carr ier Sekani .”26 But the “panoply” of remedies
described in Carrier Sekani  would not be available in such a judicial review. In the case at
26FCA Decision , AR Vol I, Tab 2  Ryer J.’s Majority Reasons paras. 72 -73. The referenced paragraph from 
Carrier Sekani  states “[t]he  Crown’s failure to consult can lead to a number of remedies ranging from injunctive 
relief against the threatening activity altogether, to damages, to an order to carry out the consultation prior to 
proceeding further with the proposed government conduct. ” Carrier Sekani , ABoA Vol I, Tab 22  at para. 37 (citing 
Haida Nation, ABoA Vol I, Tab 5  at paras. 13 -14). 
9 
 
bar, most of those remedies would only have been available if the First Nation filed an 
action —not if the breach of the  Crown’s duty was pursued by judicial review.27  
25. As Rennie J. explained in dissent, “[t]he Minister does not propose to do anything and has no 
power in respect of the decision . There is nothing to be enjoined, quashed or compelled … 
[s]ubstantively, any con sultation or accommodation which might flow from a judicial review 
would be too late.”28 Even an awa rd of damages would be denied , since “[i]t is trite to say 
that damages cannot be awarded on application for judicial review.”29 A First Nation could 
obtain , at best,  a pyrrhic  victory through a judicial review of the Crown’s failure to consult 
with respect to a section  58 application . 
26. Enbridge argues in support of an after the fact judicial remedy, asserting that “a declaration 
would be a meaningful remedy to affirm the rule of law and provide a useful guidepost for 
government actors and Aboriginal groups going forward.”30 But an ex post  declaration, after 
a project has gone forward and after the damage has been done, is cold comfort to an 
impacted Aboriginal pe ople.  Concern with the duty to consult  cannot simply be pushed 
downstream and made the subject of an after -the-fact judicial review of Crown action after 
the industrial development has already been approved . To do so is the antithesis of 
reconciliation.  Given the inadequacy of ex post remedies in the section  58 context, Rennie J. 
was correct that the proper course of action is that  the NEB “refuse to grant an approval if 
there is an unfulfilled duty to consult.”31  
                                                
27  Denying consultation in advance, and then requiring a First Nation to file an action in an attempt to have its 
rights recognized or vindicated, is  the exact problem that Haida Nation was seeking to forestall. A principal reason 
for Haida Nation’s requirement of prior Crown consultation is because “Aboriginal claims litigation can be very 
complex and require years and even decades to resolve in the c ourts . . . [w]hile Aboriginal claims can be and are 
pursued through litigation, negotiation is a preferable way of reconciling state and Aboriginal interests.” Haida
