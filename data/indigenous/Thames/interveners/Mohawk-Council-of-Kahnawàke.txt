PART I: STATEMENT OF FACTS 
1. The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke (“MCK”) adopts the facts as  outlined in the Chippewas 
of the Thames First Nation’ s (“Appellant”) Factum. 
PART II: OVERVIEW AND POSITION  ON APPELLANT’S QUESTIONS 
2. The MCK agrees with the Attorney General of Canada (“AGC”) a nd the Appellant that the 
duty to consult and accommodate was triggered by the National E nergy Board’s (“NEB”) decision 
and with the Appellant that the  duty was at the high end of the  spectrum.1 
3. Regarding the other questions i n issue, the MCK submits that : 
(A) the NEB had an obligation to assess whether the Crown fulfi lled its duty to consult and 
accommodate prior to issuing an order under s. 58 of the National Energy Board Act2 (“NEB 
Act”); 
(B) the NEB’s process and Reasons for Decision (“NEB Reasons”) did not and could not 
satisfy the requirements of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 19823 (“s. 35(1)”); and 
(C) this Court should direct the NEB to assess the fulfillment of the Crown’s duty by applying 
the legal test that will be proposed herein. 
PART III: ARGUMENT 
A. The NEB had an obligation to as sess whether the Crown fulfil led the duty to consult 
4. The NEB’s statutory grant of authority to determine question s of law includes the authority to 
assess whether consultation was required and had taken place bu t does not include the express or 
implicit authority to carry out t he Crown’s duty to consult and  accommodate.4 
5. The NEB was obligated to exercise the authority to assess co nsultation because it was the final

decision-maker for a project with adverse and potential adverse  effects on Aboriginal rights; it is 
irrelevant whether the Crown w as a party to the NEB hearings.5 
6. In Gitxaala , the majority decided that the  Governor in Council must consid er whether Canada 
has fulfilled its duty to consult prior to rendering a final de cision pursuant to  s. 52 of the NEB Act . 
The NEB has the same legal oblig ation in exercising final decis ion-making authority pursuant to 
s. 58 of the NEB Act , since it has delegated authority from Parliament.6 
7. In addition to the reasons identified by Justice Rennie,7 there are many practical reasons why 
the NEB was most suited to determine whether the Crown had fulf illed the duty to consult and 
accommodate. The NEB had the remedial powers to complete a full , explicit and timely assessment 
of Crown consultation.8  
8. The NEB could have also requested information from the parti es and the Crown on whether 
there were any outstanding project  related issues that were not  addressed through the hearing 
process and on how the government would have proposed to deal w ith those issues:  
[…] the Board may also rely on the fact that there are other pr ocesses to deal with the issue, 
and that those processes, and that any decisions resulting ther efrom, must comply with any 
relevant laws, including c onstitutional obligations. 
Where the Board cannot act beyond its mandate established by le gislation to regulate matters 
beyond its jurisdiction, it can take into consideration matters  outside of its jurisdiction when 
making its public interest decision or recommendation.9 
9. Had the NEB exercised this authority, all parties would have  had the opportunity to submit 
evidence on Crown consultation early on, including preliminary issues such as the scope of the 
duty. The NEB could have ensured that the Crown consulted Indig enous interveners regarding any 
outstanding issues throughout the hearing process and prior to making a final decision. In assessing 
and then supervising consultation, the NEB could have been an e ffective body in ensuring the 
preservation of the Honour of th e Crown. This integrated approa ch addresses concerns of

proponents and government pertai ning to efficiency, duplication  and confusion. 
10. What the MCK is proposing is not radical. For the Georgia S trait project, the NEB stated that 
it was required to assess and supervise Crown consultation thro ughout the hearing process; this 
resulted in the conclusion of s atisfactory agreements with affe cted Indigenous Nations.10  
11. However, due to the NEB’s failure to assess and supervise c onsultation during the hearing 
process, the Appellant’s concerns were not addressed and the on ly recourse was to pursue 
expensive and time-consuming litigation with the courts, result ing in uncertainty f or all parties.  
12. The question of whether the N EB had the obligation to asses s if the Crown had a duty to 
consult and whether it was fulfilled is reviewable on the stand ard of correctness.11 
B. The NEB’s process did not and could not satisfy the requirem ents of s. 35(1) 
i) Scope of the project 
13. The assertion that Enbridge’s project is minor is specious.  The application involved a major 
repurposing of an old pipeline to  authorize the transportation of 300,000 barrels of heavy crude oil 
per day. The number and scope of issues covered by the hearing order, the hearing duration and 
the number of interveners demonstr ate that this was a very larg e and complex project, assessed in 
consideration of the  national interest.12 
14. Secondly, the scope of the project is not relevant to deter mining whether the NEB should 
have assessed Crown consultation. The determination of scope wo uld be relevant to the NEB’s 
appreciation of the content of t he duty to consult, but under n o circumstances would it negate the 
legal obligation for the NEB  to assess Crown consultation. 
ii) Reconciliation and the import ance of Crown engagement in th e context of large 
projects 
15. The overarching goal of s. 35(1) is reconciliation.13 Included in this framework is the duty to

consult and accommodate Indigenous Nations.  
16. This duty is rooted in the recognition that Indigenous Nati ons were here before Europeans 
and were never conquered; it ensures that the Honour of the Cro wn is preserved pending the 
determination of Aboriginal ri ghts and the conclusion of nation -to-nation treaties.14 For the MCK, 
the goal is to move toward a renewed relationship that is “root ed in the two-row wampum tradition 
of autonomy, mutual respect and friendship”.15 
17. As this Court has explained, consultation “is a distinct an d often complex constitutional 
process and, in certain circums tances, a right involving facts,  law, policy and compromise”.16 
18. The courts have not fully considered how Indigenous governa nce rights inform the duty to 
consult.17 However, international law rec ognizes that achieving reconcili ation encompasses the 
recognition of the jurisdictiona l rights of Indigenous Nations.18 This is especially true for decisions 
pertaining to large or complex projects where policy and nation al public interest decisions are at 
issue, as was the case with the NEB’s decision.19 
19. The nation-to-nation relationship involves the reconciliati on of sovereignties and 
worldviews, including fundament ally different philosophical and  cultural systems:20 
The reconciliation is of sovereignties, with its ultimate expre ssion being in developing 
shared and collaborative pattern s of how sovereigns will intera ct with each other with respect 
to governing and making decisions. Reconciliation of this natur e and scope is not a mere 
adjustment to processes of Cro wn decision-making, or a mechanis tic and formulaic

exchange of information. It is m uch broader, extensive and comp lex than this.21 
20. In recent cases, the courts have implied that the Crown has  discretion to develop the 
consultation processes in which Indigenous Nations must partici pate.22 The MCK submits that this 
is not established law and that there are compelling arguments challenging this view.23 Regardless, 
when the Crown does unilaterally establish a process, it is imp ortant that there be “[…] an openness 
to challenges from those who see exclusions and limitations in the design of a given dispute 
resolution process, and mechanisms  to adjust procedures in an o ngoing way”.24 
21. These fundamental aspects of r econciliation were completely  ignored in the present case. The 
Crown’s unilateral determinati on that the NEB process was suffi cient, its non-existent engagement 
within the context of the hearing,25 combined with the categorical refusal to discuss outstanding 
concerns pertaining to the process and project are incompatible  w i t h  t h e  M C K ’ s  v i e w  o n  
reconciliation. This creates a “disconnect between Aboriginal p eoples and the Crown”26 and is 
contrary to the requirements a nd purpose of the duty.  The Crow n ran roughshod ove r the Honour 
of the Crown, perpetuating the practice condemned by Kahane: 
It is tempting for members of dominant cultures to try to escap e these dilemmas by appealing 
to neutralist models of adjudica tion or by using general templa tes for interpreting cultures and 
incorporating them into deliberative processes […] both neutral ist models and “one size fits 
all” accounts of intercultural decision making tend to privileg e dominant worldviews, at the 
expense of the perspectives and i nterests of marginalized group s.27 
22. Moreover, the Crown could not use the NEB process as ground s to refuse to engage with

the Appellant; such refusals ar e routinely considered breaches of the Crown’s duty.28  
iii) The NEB was not delegated the duty to consult and accommod ate 
23. Enbridge argues that the NEB was implicitly empowered to ca rry out the Crown’s duty to 
consult and accommodate. This is false. The NEB was responsible  for assessing the biophysical 
impacts of the project on Aboriginal rights and for measuring t hese impacts against the public 
interest.29 While there may be some overlap  between the NEB’s role and the Crown’s duty, there 
is no equivalency between the NE B’s role and the Crown’s duty, and therefore there can be no 
implicit empowerment:  
[…] the difficulty with the NEB  reasoning is that the meaning o f ‘adverse effect’ in Haida 
and the meaning of ‘harm’ or ‘impact’ used by the NEB represent  very different standards 
when considering whether the duty has been triggered and whethe r it has been 
accommodated.  
[…] the meaning of ‘adverse effect’ as articulated in Haida  is much broader than that of 
‘impact’ and ‘harm’ used by the NEB. Unlike ‘impact’ or ‘harm’ tests, the ‘adverse effects’ 
test does not need to have an immediate or tangible impact on l ands and resources. It can 
flow from abstract Crown conduct,  such as high-level managerial , organizational or policy 
changes […]30 
24. Secondly, there is no reason w hy the Crown’s choice to rely  on an administrative body’s 
Aboriginal consultation should amo unt to implicit delegation to  carry out the Crown’s duty. 
iv) The NEB Reasons do not constitute accommodation or fulfill the s. 35(1) duty 
25. Canada’s interpretation of the NEB Reasons, including the c onditions imposed for approval 
of the project, as full accomm odation of all of the Appellant’s  issues is wrong.  
26. Any tribunal that purports to consult and accommodate by it self must possess the necessary 
remedial powers.31 In this case, the NEB had the remedial powers to assess and su pervise 
consultation but it did not have the powers necessary to discha rge the duty itself. As will be

demonstrated, the situation desc ribed below by the NEB applies to this case: 
[…] there may be certain instances where an issue raised or ide ntified by an Aboriginal 
group during consultation on a project cannot be remedied throu gh the proponent’s actions 
or through the imposition of conditions by the Board.32 
27. The AGC also acknowledged the limitations of the NEB’s powe rs in indicating that 
tribunals can accommodate Aborig inal concerns only “to the exte nt possible”.33 
28. In an attempt to justify any shortcomings, Enbridge mistake nly relies on administrative law 
to support the assertion that the NEB Reasons do not have to be  perfect or comprehensive.34 As 
determined in Gitxaala , providing reasons under administrative law does not mean that t he separate 
constitutional duty to consult a nd accommodate has been fulfill ed.35 
29. The NEB’s assertion that inter veners had the opportunity to  express all concerns related to 
the project is false. Interve ners, including the Appellant and the MCK, were limited by the NEB’s 
exclusive List of Issues. For example, concerns related to ener gy policy, the upstream or 
downstream GHG emissions related to the project36 and cumulative impacts37 could not be raised. 
Similar to Gitxaala , the List of Issues only covere d some subjects on which consul tation was 
required and was narrower than the Crown’s duty.38  
30. On several occasions, the AGC and Enbridge significantly ov erstate the extent to which the 
NEB Reasons address the Appellant’s concerns. For example, in r esponse to concerns pertaining 
to “providing economic accommoda tion for potential impacts to t he Appellant’s rights”, the AGC 
answers that: “the Board’s decision outlines the steps required  of the proponent Enbridge to ensure 
its financial responsibility for any damages or impacts arising  in the unlikely event of an impact on 
Aboriginal rights.”39 The NEB Reasons cited by the AGC do not address the Appellant’ s concerns 
in any way, as they do not mention the Appellant’s Aboriginal r ights or the manner in which 
Enbridge addresses financial resp onsibility for impacts to thes e rights. This type of vague

remedial rein” required to take over all aspects of the duty to  consult from the Crown, see R v Conway , [2010] 1 SCR 765, 
2010 SCC 22 at par as 82 and 97, IMBA, Tab 7 ; See also AGC Factum in Clyde River at para 64.

“addressing of concerns” was condemned in Gitxaala.40 
31. In fact, the NEB solely assessed the biophysical impacts of  the project on Aboriginal rights 
and measured these against the public interest. The additional recommendations and outstanding 
concerns raised by the Appellant  and other Indigenous intervene rs were never assessed by the NEB 
or the Crown with respect to the duty to consult. The NEB never  measured the project’s potential 
adverse impacts on the Appellant  with respect to “any known leg al standard nor treated 
constitutional obligations to cons ult as relevant to approval”.41  
32. Further, the NEB lacked the power to order many types of ac commodation measures that 
could apply to large projects su ch as pipelines. For example, t he NEB could not ord er the creation 
of intergovernmental monitoring bod ies that include Indigenous governments, whereas the Crown, 
acting through a government depart ment, can negotiate the creat ion of such bodies.42  
33. In addition, the use of adminis trative tribunals to carry o ut Crown accommodation for large 
projects is not desirable from a policy standpoint. Courts have  been reticent to impose 
accommodation, and have preferred a supervisory role in orderin g the parties to negotiate in good 
faith.43 This allows for effective and substantive negotiations, the pr eferred means to achieving 
reconciliation. It is time for this Court to direct tribunals t o play a similar role. 
34. Since the NEB did not assess whether the duty was fulfilled , or whether there were any 
outstanding concerns that require d consideration, it would be i nappropriate for this Court to 
conduct its own “after the fact” assessment of the sufficiency of the NEB’s process:  
Judicial review requires the court to rely on the accuracy and completeness of the expert 
tribunal’s findings. [...] If th e tribunal’s record is incomple te and/or silent on whether the 
duty has been triggered and fulfilled, the court’s assessment o f the adequacy of Crown 
consultation may be equally lacking.44 
35. The AGC’s assertion that partic ipation in the NEB’s process  meant that deep consultation 
occurred is unfounded. The MCK agrees with the Appellant that, in spite of participation in the 
NEB’s process, many of the Appellant’s concerns were not addres sed or were not substantially 
addressed.45 To the extent that the Crown re lied on the NEB process to addr ess these outstanding

concerns for the fulfillment of the constitutional duty to cons ult, it did so in error.46 
C. The NEB should assess adequacy by determining whether the du ty was fully met 
36. If this Court grants the appeal, quashes the order and send s the application back to the NEB 
for a final decision, this Cour t should provide guidance to the  NEB on the applicable legal test for 
assessing whether the Crown m et the duty to consult and accommo date. 
37. At the FCA, Justice Rennie argues, building on Carrier Sekani , that if the NEB was the final 
decision-maker it “[…] was requi red to ask whether the consulta tion had taken place”47 as a first 
step in its assessment of whether the duty was met. 
38. Subsequently, in Gitxaala , the majority proposed a “reason able satisfaction” standard fo r 
determining whether the duty to consult has been fulfilled, in order “not to hold Ca nada to anything 
approaching the sta ndard of perfection”.48 This standard must be rejected; given the constitutional 
nature of the duty to consult, t he duty must be fully met.49 
39. The majority in Gitxaala  confused the process and outcome of consultation and 
accommodation (neither of which must result in perfect satisfac tion, as per Haida50) with the 
applicable standard for reviewi ng whether the duty has been ful filled. 
40. While the MCK agrees with the majority in Gitxaala  that final decision-makers must ensure 
that the specific concerns rai sed by Indigenous Nations are “sp ecifically addressed”, we disagree 
that deep consultation must lead to the demonstration of seriou s “consideration of 
accommodation”. The Crown must demonstrate more than considerat ion of accommodation 
(which is procedural), it must a lso demonstrate that it has spe cifically and substantially addressed 
and accommodated each concern raised by Indigenous Nations, as appropriate.51 
41. To determine the appropriate  level of consultation, the NEB  should have first determined 
where this project was on the spectrum of the duty to consult ( based on the Haida  f a c t o r s52). 
Following this assessment, the MCK submits that the NEB should have applied this test:
