 PART I – OVERVIEW  
1. Elsipogtog First Nation (“Elsipogtog” or “the First Nation” ) intervenes with leave of this 
Court granted on October 22, 2020.  
2. Elsipogtog is a First Nation situated in New Brunswick, along the shoreline of the 
Richibucto River north of Moncton. It has filed a specific claim with the federal government based 
on the loss of 90% of the reserve lands , originally  set aside for it by the Lieutenant Governor of 
the colony of New Brunswick in 1802, and unlawfully taken in 1824 . The claim has recently been 
accepted for negotiation. It is very familiar with the process for the resolution of specific claims, 
including the me chanics of the Specific Claims Tribunal Act (“SCTA”),1 by virtue of its current 
and past engagement in the process and by virtue of retaining lawyers who served as counsel to 
the Specific Claims Tribunal for a combined decade , and since the Tribunal’s inception . 
3. Elsipogtog intervenes on the issue of the principles of equitable compensation applied by 
the Trial Judge and upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal, and particularly their inconsistency 
with the principles of compensation under the  SCTA. Elsipog tog submits that the compensation 
scheme of the SCTA  should be considered by this Honourable Court in this appeal, given its 
importance as a reflection of principles accepted and endorsed by First Nations and as a vehicle  
for reconciliation. Allowing the a ppeal would provide this Honourable Court  with the opportunity  
to articulate principles of compensation consistent with, or at least not inconsistent with, the SCTA . 
Dismissal of  the appeal would risk inconsistent or unfair rulings from the SCT and between SCT 
and court decisions. Dismissal would also hinder the reconciliation of Indigenous and other  
Canadians, by creating delay and uncertainty in the resolution of historic grievances that continue 
to burden Crown -Indigenous relatio ns. This Honourable Court has the rare opportunity in this 
appeal to clarify principles of compensation, facilitat ing the fair and efficient resolution of specific 
claims , and advance rather than hinder reconciliation.  
                                                 
1 Specific Claims Tribunal Act , SC 2008, c 22 [ SCTA ]. 2 
 PART II – QUESTIONS IN ISSUE  
4. The cent ral issue in this appeal relates to compensation for harms caused by Canada’s 
fiduciary breaches , which Elsipogtog submits should be done in a way that is consistent with the 
objective of reconciliation and with legislation, in particular the SCTA . 
PART III – ARGUMENT  
5. This submission will first provide background on the specific claims resolution process. It 
will then show how the ruling at issue undermines the coherence of the SCTA . It then shows why 
it is important to consider the SCTA  in this proceedin g, and how dismissing the instant appeal may 
lead to inconsistent rulings as well as delays and potentially insurmountable obstacles in the 
reconciliation of Indigenous Canadians and the Crown  with respect to specific claims . 
A. Background: The Specific Claim s Resolution Process  
6. The specific claims resolution process is the way many First Nations with claims similar 
to that in the instant appeal seek resolution of their claims. Specific claims are historic, are against 
the federal Crown, and relate to the administration of land or assets and to the fulfilment of treaties.  
Where Crown breaches are ongoing, such as in the instant case, a claim may be advanced before 
the courts . However , for many First Nations , the specific claims  process ’ disallowance of Crown 
defences to claims based on the passage of time2 makes it the only option  for resolving their claims . 
More than 500 claims are currently under consideration by the government or the Specific Claims 
Tribunal ( “SCT” ),3 and First Nations continue to research and develop more claims  as they are 
discovered through research , litigation,  awareness  and oral history.  
7. Briefly, specific claims follow two general stages: negotiation and adjudication. Once a 
specific claim is subm itted to the government , the Specific Claims Branch of Crown -Indigenous 
Relations and Northern Affairs Canada  (the “Branch” ) determines whether it will offer to 
negotiate the claim in whole or in part. It is time -limited in both its review  and in the negotiation 
                                                 
2 SCTA , supra  note 1, s 19.  
3 “Reporting Centre on Specific Claims” (last modified 21 September 2020), online: 
<services.aadnc -aandc.gc.ca/SCBRI_E/Main/ReportingCentre/External/externalreporting.aspx >. 3 
 itself . If the Branch fails to respond or negotiate in a timely manner, rejects a claim or negotiations 
fail, the First Nation claimant may file a claim with the SCT and commence adjudication .4 
8. The SCT is governed by the SCTA , which  provides that a roster of superior court judges 
adjudicate claims  fully and finally .5 Since its operational inception in 2011, the SCT has 
contributed to shaping the definition of the Crown’s lawful obligations  in the context of claims 
such as the one at issue here , both in terms of their breach , their obligation to compensate , and the 
guiding principles in an assessment of compensation in equity .6 Indeed, the Trial Decision 
discussed two SCT judgments when considering applicable principles of equitable co mpensation.7 
The courts consider such cases less often and arguably offer no equivalent body of jurisprudence.8 
9. The SCTA  enumerates six grounds on which a claim may be found valid  and thus 
compensable . One concerns breaches of treaty and other agreements; another concerns fraud by 
Crown agents. The four of potential significance in this submission concern violations of the 
Indian Act , breach of fiduciary duty in the administration of reserve lands, an illegal disposition of 
reserve lands, or the failure to compensate for reserve lands taken or damaged under legal 
authority .9 
10. When a claim is found to be valid on one of these grounds, t he SCTA  then prescribes 
detailed compensation principles. It provides at section 20(1)(c) that the Tribunal is to apply 
“principles of compensation applied by the courts” . Moving from the general to the specific, it

 then lays out particular principles that apply with respect to valuing reserve land  in two different 
circumstances. For land “taken under legal authority” but in adequately compensated,  
compensation shall be awarded for the market value of the land at the time of the taking  brought 
forward to present value. If the lands were damaged under legal authority, the SCT shall also award 
the “value of the damage done to re serve lands brought forward to the current value of the loss.”10 
By contrast, for “lands were never lawfully surrendered, or otherwise taken under legal authority,” 
the SCTA  provides that compensation shall be based on the “current, unimproved market value ” 
of the lands, plus the value of the loss of use of those lands brought forward to present value .11 
B. Inconsistencies with the Trial Decision and the SCTA  Compensation Scheme  
11. The Trial Decision approach to compensation  is inconsistent with the principles in the 
SCTA . Applying the instant case to the SCTA  framework, it is clear that t he Trial Judge found that 
the claim was valid under section 14 of the SCTA : there had been a breach of fiduciary duty and a 
violation of the Indian Act  in the failure to expropriate or obtain a surrender of the lands .12 Under 
the scheme of the SCTA , sub -section 20(1)(g) and (h) would apply, compensating the First Nation 
for lands that were “never lawfully surrendered, or otherwise taken under legal author ity.” 
However, the Trial Decision applied sub -section 20(1)(e) and (f), namely, the value of land at the 
time of the taking and damage done to the lands brought forward  to present value ,13 which applies 
at the SCT where land was taken under legal authority but was inadequately compensated. This is 
squarely inconsistent with the provisions of the SCTA  and, if the appeal is dismissed, will create 
binding precedent for the SCT which contradicts the provisions of its governing statute . 
C. Reconciliatory Role of the SCTA  
12. The SCTA  is a reconciliatory instrument that should be considered even outside of the SCT . 
It is the product of historic and significant collaboration between the Government of Canada and 
the Assembly of First Nations.14 The AFN and Canada negotiated its terms, the compensation 
terms particularly, and First Nations continue to be involved in the operation and review of the 
Specific Claims Tribunal.15 Elsipogtog submits that it is the only legal instrument that clearly

 reflects First Nations buy -in and agreement  to the terms of the resolution of their historical 
grievances, including their compensation. In no other piece of legislation or law has the perspective 
of First Nations been so fully taken into account, in terms of their  actual participation in 
determining the adjudicative principles governing their claims. It constitutes a melding or 
compromise of government and First Nations views, an example of the possibility of co -existence 
and collaboration. It is, in a word, an exa mple of reconciliation. For this reason, Elsipogtog submits 
that the compensation framework set out in the SCTA  should be viewed as a reflection of a fair 
and reconciliatory approach to resolving specific claims , and d eviations from it must reflect the 
same considered accommodation and inclusion of the Indigenous perspective as went into 
developing it. As several of our fellow intervenors have capably argued, there is no evidence that 
the Indigenous perspective was given such consideration by the lower cour ts. 
D. Risks to Rule of Law  
13. If the instant appeal is dismissed and the Trial Decision allowed to stand, the internal 
coherence of the SCTA  will be undermined. This increases the risks of inconsistent rulings from 
the SCT, as well as between the SCT and other adjudicative mechanisms not bound by the SCTA , 
such as the courts. Elsipogtog submits that this amounts to a risk to the rule of law, which demands 
fairness and equality before the law.  
14. The substantial risk of incoherence lays in the  divergence in the  general and more specific 
provisions of the SCTA  governing compensation. The SCTA  requires that the SCT must apply “the 
principles of compensation applied by the courts,” as well as the specific provisions of the SCTA  
governing compensation for land taken  under legal authority and not lawfully surrendered or 
otherwise taken under legal authority. Here, the principles of compensation applied by the Trial 
Court do not conform to the specific provisions that follow ; they disregarded the breaches of 
obligation  they found in the Crown’s conduct in the flooding of Lac Seul First Nation (“ LSFN ”) 
land, in finding hypothetical  lawfulness. It  is not clear how the SCT would reconcile the 
inconsistency , for example in a case involving facts similar to the instant one. The tools used by 
the Trial Judge  to determine the applicable principles of compensation  – the use of a hypothetical  
taking , effectually translating to  a legal taking for the purposes of assessing equitable 
compensation  – are not available to the SCT. Unde r section 20, reserve lands are either taken with 
legal authority, or they are not. A taking may not be hypothetically  legal. It is arguably not within 6 
 the SCT’s jurisdiction, as a statutory body, to make such a finding.  At the very least, it is unclear, 
and could cause uncertainty and delay pending judicial review, contrary to the SCT’s mandate.  
15. Even if the use of hypothetical legality is possible, it is not difficult to foresee inconsistent 
decisions resulting from incoherence in the SCTA . The SCT would l ikely be forced to distinguish 
the instant case, if it stood, on a factual basis . That is, t he more factually -analogous a claim to the 
instant one, the more likely the SCT  would apply the approach of the Trial Judge; the less factually -
analogous, the more likely the provisions of 20(1)(g) and (h) would apply. Claims that may be 
factually dissimilar in terms of the Crown’s wrongdoing may yet be similar in other legally 
significant ways, however, making such differences in compensation unfair. Take, f or examp le, 
claims involving a flawed surrender and a  flawed expropriation, respectively. Both may be 
undertaken for a public works project. It is foreseeable that land taken for a similar public purpose, 
both without First Nation consent but by different means – surrender versus expropriation – may 
be compensated by different provisions of the  SCTA  and indeed different compensatory regimes  
in the result . This seems to be manifestly unfair to the First Nation, who likely played no role in 
the decision to seek a surrender or an expropriation,  and is  illogical from a compensation 
perspective . 
16. The risk of inconsistent decisions between the SCT and courts or other adjudicative 
tribunals becomes even greater, owing to the non-binding nature of the SCTA  in other forums.  
17. The inconsistency will have real and immediate effects for claims currently in the 
compensation stage at the Tribunal. Several of these involve contexts and histories not adjudicated 
outside of the SCT, which nonetheless stand to be affected by the instant decision. For example, 
Williams Lake , the validity of which was affirmed by this H onourable Court, is now in the 
compensation phase of its claim before the Tribunal. It is one of the many cases at the Tribunal 
concerning reserve creation issues in the Maritimes, Quebec and British Columbia, and in which 
the SCT has generally  found that Crown officials breached their obligations by, inter alia , the 
failure to set aside specific lands of significance to the First Nation in question in the reserves 
allotted to them. Allowing the Trial Decision to stand would introduce some uncertainty around 
the relevance of the breaches of fidudiary duty found in the validity decision and whether they can 7 
 be disregarded, as they arguably were in the lower court decisions, in the dete rmination of 
applicable principles of equitable compensation.  
18. Elsipogtog submits that this should not be condoned . Progress  which has been made in 
certainly  and finally determining divisive  and harmful  historic claims should not be disrupted by 
the introdu ction of new areas of  uncertainty. We ask that this Honourable  Court , with the benefit 
of the awareness of the diversity of types of claims which the instant decision will affect, clarify 
the consequences of Crown breaches of its legal obligations in a man ner that is consistent with the 
SCTA  and with the basic principle that the nature of breaches should not be disregarded in the  
calculation of equitable compensation.  
E. Risks to Reconciliation  
19. The uncertainty that the dismissal of the instant appeal would create with respect to the 
compensation of specific claims would have knock -on effects on the resolution of specific claims 
down the line, ultimately affecting the speed and even the possibilit y of reconciliation.  
20. The specific claims  process is affected by developments in the case law through the Federal 
Government’s stated objective with respect to resolving specific claims, which is to “discharge its 
lawful obligations.”16 SCT jurisprudence is highly relevant in determining what the Crown’s 
“lawful obligations” are in terms of their breach and compensation , as it addresses claims that the 
government failed to resolve. Assuming the good faith desire of the Crown to resolve claims, it is 
logical t o assume that the positions it takes on whether lawful  obligations were breached and how 
they might be discharged have been influenced by SCT jurisprudence. Moreover, the Specific 
Claims Policy largely reflects the compensation scheme in the SCTA . 
21. Allowing  the Trial Decision to stand would create inconsistency and uncertainty with 
respect to applicable legal principles.  It would become more difficult for Branch negotiators to 
determine what the government’s “lawful obligations” are with respect to compensation in equity  
and more difficult for First Nations to value their claims. It would also make it more likely that 
there would be a significant difference between Crown and First Nation valuation of claims, to the 
extent that Crown negotiators favou r the lower -value approach followed in the instant case and 
                                                 
16 INAC, Policy and Process Guide , supra  note 4 at 5. 8 
 First Nations continue to look to the SCTA  for governing principles. This would make negotiations 
more protracted; potentially lead  to settlements that First Nations do not consider to be a full a nd 
final answer to the historic injustice it suffered; and, in the worst case, possibly lead to the failure 
of negotiations altogether.  
22. This would be bad for Canada  and all Canadians . The resolution of specific claims is 
integral to reconciliation , for Els ipogtog and for hundreds of other First Nations. The Preamble of 
the SCTA  acknowledges the reconciliatory function of the SCTA,17 as does Canada’s Specific 
Claims Policy.18 In order for First Nations and Canada to move forward, historic wrongs must be 
addressed. All Canadians have an interest in the fair resolution of specific claims ,19 and a failure 
to address specific claims in a meaningful and timely way can lead to tragic events, such as in Oka, 
Ipperwash, Caledonia, Gustapheson Lake, and others.20 
23. The risks of failure of negotiations could be even higher  for claims that will not end up 
before the SCT. Where claimants may not avail themselves of an independent adjudicative 
mechanism, at the SCT or in the courts, they have less leverage in opposition to  Crown negotiating 
positions and claim valuations. To the extent that the Trial Decision will justify a lower valuation 
of claims by negotiators, claimants in this position will have less ability to negotiate values upward . 
There are many claims that this will affect : those such as Elsipogtog and many other Mi’kmaq 
nations which exceed the compensation cap at the SCT; those who seek more than just a monetary 
remedy; or those including non -pecuniary losses; or those whose value does not justify the costs 
of a lawyer which is required at the SCT.21 Claimants in these categories will be further 
disadvantaged in a process in which they are already disadvantaged by the absence of independent 
adjudication  leading to a fair recovery of proven losses .

 24. Elsipogtog beli eves that  it can provide an  illustration of how  allowing the instant appeal to 
stand would adversely affect its ability to negotiate its claim in the ways discussed above. Its claim 
relates to a unilateral change in the size of the Richibucto River Reserve  in 1824, in the colony of 
New Brunswick. A colonial council wrote down the size of the Reserve by approximately 46,600 
acres representing roughly 90% of the Reserve without compensation or consent. Elsipogtog 
understands this to be a clear illegal taking of its land, to be compensated by its current unimproved 
market value and the value of its loss of use over time. It remains concerned, however, about the 
extent to which Crown negotiators may argue that the land hypothetically  could have been taken 
legall y, justifying compensation on the basis of its historical value brought forward. Such 
arguments have little merit, but in the absence of a recourse to the SCT or the courts, Elsipogtog 
may face a compensation offer from the Crown of far less than what it i s expecting and less than 
what it deems necessary to adequately compen sate for its historical losses.  
25. An offer based on the Trial Decision approach would be detrimental to Elsipogtog not only 
for monetary reasons, but also for reasons related to reconcilia tion. The land at issue was central 
to the First Nation’s sustenance, its role in the system of trade and alliances, and its identity and 
place in the world. Its taking, flying in the face of the Royal Proclamation, 1763  and the treaties 
of peace and frien dship, constituted a fundamental and original betrayal that continues to colour 
Elsipogtog’s view of the Crown  and its subjects . Making amends for this betrayal would start to 
heal these wounds and put to rest the mistrust that has coloured relations since  the early 1800s . 
Offering only partial amends would not suffice. Any further delay or obstacle in the process of 
finally resolving Elsipogtog’s claim will have a clear impact on the project that this Honourable 
Court has deemed  as the “governing ethos” of  Indigenous -Crown relations – being  reconciliation , 
not competition,  entrenched in section 35  – and has repeatedly called for.22 Reconciliation is not 
facultative. Rather, reconciliation is a legal imperative woven by the various pronouncements and 
principl es enunciated by this Honourable Court.
