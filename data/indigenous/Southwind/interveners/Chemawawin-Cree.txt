PART I –  OVERVIEW  
1. The Chemawawin Cree Nation (“CCN” ) intervenes in this case because its own reserve 
land was flooded for hydro -electric purposes after Canada obtained a surrender in breach of its 
fiduciary duty to CCN. The principles that govern the Crown’s fiduciary duty when reserve land 
is taken for public purposes , and the principles for determin ing appropriate compensation when 
the duty is breached, are of critical importance to CCN.  
2. Any just resolution of claims by First Nations who have been deprived of their lands  
requires the recognition of  the po werful role of First Nations ’ relationship to their lands in 
sustaining the well -being of their communities , and the need to account for the full range of harms 
suffered wh en their connection with the land is impaired.  The Crown , as fiduciary and treaty 
partner, has an obligation to protect that connection. When a First Nation ’s land is  taken or used 
for public purposes,  the Crown’s fiduciary obligation requires preservation, to the greatest extent 
possible, of the First Nation ’s interests in the land. This  includes  their interest in using  the benefits 
generated from the land  to sustain their people and their cultures in a manner that permits them to 
prosper and flourish.   
3. Reserve l ands held under treaty are not mere real estate –  they are foundational to a First 
Nations’ continuing existence as a people. The trial judge treated the Crown’s breach of fiduciary 
duty as a mere failure to provide the compensation that would have been payable for an 
expropriation of privately held land. This approach fails to tak e into account the special nature of 
a First Nation’s  interest in reserve lands, particularly those held under a treaty, and the distinct 
fiduciary relationship that is grounded in the pre -existing sovereignty and territorial rights of First 
Nations. The special nature of First Nations ’ inte rests include s the social, cultural, spiritual  
components  of their unique relationship with the land, and the autonomy to u se the land as a 
platform and driver of economic growth and development for the community  into th e future . The 
Crown’s fiduciary obligation require s it to ensure that all of those interests are protecte d, and where 
that is not possible, that the First Nation’s loss is fully compensated.  
4. Assessing the land’s value based on  expropriation  principles  does not compensate the First 
Nation for what it has lost, and does not  hold the Crown to the standard required of a fiduciary and 
treaty partner.  As Justice Gleason held in her dissenting judgment, the Crown could have sought a 2 
surrender of the land. The Crown’s fiduciary duty would have required it to ensure , inter alia , that 
the First Nation was fully informed about the project’s impact on all of their interests , and that the 
terms of any surrender were not i mprovident  in light of those  impact s. If the full extent of the  First 
Nation’s  loss from the flooding  could not be adequately addressed,  including the protection of 
their treaty right to maintain their mode of life and sustain themselves from the land, permitting a 
surrender would not be consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary obligations.  
5. If the Crown breaches its obligations  with respect to First Nations’ land taken for a public 
purpose, equity support s a flexible approach to compensation that allows a First Nation  to request, 
and the court to award, a remedy that will make it whole.  One appropriate approach is to base 
compensation on the value that is realized from the  new use of the lands. This approach is 
consistent with restoring the relationship between the benefits from the land and the First Nat ion, 
and replaces what they should have received - a negotiated settlement consistent wi th the h onour 
of the Crown and a mutually respectful treaty partnership.   
PART II  - POSITION ON THE APPELLANT’S QUE STIONS  
6. The Chemawawin Cree Nation takes no position on t he outcome of the appeal.  
PART III -  STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT  
7. The trial judge’s approach reduced  the fiduciary duty to nothing more than an obligation 
to pay the expropriation value of privately held land.  The trial judge found Canada was only 
obliged to “obt ain a fair and reasonable price” which the judge equated with “fair market value of 
the land” and that this was the measure of Lac Seul First nation (“ LSFN ”)’s loss.1 The effect of 
this finding is that the First Nation ’s interest in land is treated the sam e as that of an ordinary land 
owner, who would normally also be entitled to market value upon a forced taking.  This approach 
leads to an absurd  result : the Crown’s fiduciary obligation to the First Nation will be fulfilled if 
the Crown treats the land as i t would that of any other landowner to whom no such obligation is 
owed, that is, by providing market value.  In fact, the fiduciary duty requires much more.

The Nature of First Nations ’ Interest in Reserve Land and the Crown’s Fiduciary Duty 
8. The honour of  the Crown – an organizing principle in Aboriginal law – recognizes  that
w
hen the Crown asserted  sovereignty over Canadian territories, it did so in the face of pre -existing
Aboriginal sovereignty and territorial rights.2 When the Crown assumes “discretionary control
over specific Aboriginal interests, the honour of the Crown gives rise to a fiduciary duty”.3 The
link between First Nations’ interests in the land and pre -existing sovereignty is key to
understanding that reserve land is not merely fungible ac reage, but rather a means for First Nations
to exercise their autonomy and sustain their people and their cultures into the future, in a manner
that permits them to prosper and flourish. The Crown’s fiduciary obligation includes safeguardi ng
the
se various interest s that First Nations have in their land.
9. This Court  recognized in Osoyoos that it is inappropriate to apply common law real
property rules to First Nations’ reserve lands.4 The majority held that reserve lands are intended
to preserve the “ importa nt cultural component that reflects the relationship between an Aboriginal
community and the land and the inherent and unique value in the land itself w hich is enjoye d by
t
he community”5 – and, indeed, which forms part of their very identity. This is consi stent with
what the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples said about the relationship between FirstNations and their land:
Aboriginal people have told us of their special relationship to the land and its resources. 
This relationship, they say, is both s piritual and material, not only one of livelihood, but 
of community and indeed of the continuity of their cultures and societies.

10. When a First Nation  loses the use of its lands, the core of the harm is interference with the
First Nation’s relationship wit h those lands, a relationship that anchors their autonomy, their
culture, their well -being , and their livelihood. When this deprivation occurs in the context of a

breach of the Crown’s fiduciary obligations, an effective remedial response must be capable o f 
addressing all of these negative impacts.  
11. Expropriation law principles are unsuitable for this task. The calculation of compensation 
under expropriation principles presupposes that the land is fungible, and that the landowner can 
use the compensation to obtain replacement land in the free market that is roughly comparable in 
quantity and quality to the land taken. This is not true of First Nations land.7 As Robert Mainville 
explains : 
[t]he concept of market value appeals to a commercial perspective, but i t fails to take into 
account the special relationship and bond between Aboriginal Peoples and their traditional 
lands and activities, and it ignores the cultural, spiritual, and social aspects of Aboriginal 
and treaty rights.  Aboriginal cultures are often rooted in a relationship with particular 
territories. The use of such territories for activities unrelated to or incompatible with 
traditional Aboriginal activities can result in the disruption of Aboriginal societies –  a 
damaging effect that can never be captured in the concept of market value.8 
12. There can be no doubt that First Nations have a unique relationship with their land that is 
distinct from ordinary incidents of land ownership. Loss associated with the deprivation of the use 
of land for many decad es, as occurred here, is not fully compensated by an award of market value.   
13. For the goals of equitable compensation to be fully realized, compensation must restore, as 
far as possible, the position of the First Nation in every respect. Although fiduciary law already 
embraces the concept of restitution, there is a further reason to do so here: to repair, maintain, and 
protect the special relationship between Canada and the First Nation. In the First Nations context, 
restitution involves many dimensions beyond the economic cost. While the nature of losses and 
long-term impacts will vary, numerous harms not captured in an expropriation model are likely to 
arise when First Nations are deprived of the benefit of their traditional territories , including  social, 
cultural,  spiritual and environmental impacts.9

14. The economic component of the loss is multidimensional and intertwined with the First 
Nations’ autonomy and cultural survival as a people. This includes not only the obvious loss of 
land as a means of providin g an ongoing livelihood, but the deprivation of the right to control 
future land uses that may be more profitable. Without the benefit of  autonomy over the land base 
they were entitled to  under the Treaty , a First Nation’s ability to provide opportunities for their 
community  into the future may be severely impaired.   
Lands held under treaty are the s ubject of the treaty partnership  
15. First Nations like LSFN are also not ordinary landowners because they are partners within 
an ongoing treaty relationship.10 Treaties are sacred agreements11 setting out the framework 
whereby Indigenous and settler peoples have agreed to share lands and resources : “the first step in 
a long journey that is unlikely to end any time soon.”12 
16. A critical aspect of the treaty partnership is  the Crown’s commitment to protect lands and 
resources for the use of the First Nation in order to continue their way of life and their relationship 
to the land.13 Lands held under t reaty arrangements are not only ancestral homes, they are a key 
component of the reconciliation of competing sovereignties that treaties are meant to achieve.  
17. When land and resources that are fundamental to the rights of First Nations  are taken for 
other purposes, it is not just a promise that is broken: the relationship  itself i s undermined. As 
Justice La Forest, concurring in Delgamuukw , pointed out, “fair compensation in the present 
context is not equated with the price of a fee simple. Rather, compensation must be viewed in 
terms of the right and in keeping with the honour of the Crown.”14 
18. Further, the character of Aboriginal and treaty rights -  including the collective, cultural and 
historical nature of these rights - requires that losses “ should be compensated not only in terms of

present value, but also in terms that take int o account the loss of the future uses of the land and the 
consequential long- term impacts on the affected Aboriginal society .”15 
19. Arguably, as LS FN’s treaty  partner, Canada did not have the ability to unilaterally decide 
how the LSFN’s land would be used.  Given the lack of evidence  about Treaty 3 , it is not necessary 
or appropriate for the Court to decide this point.  But at the very least, the nature of treaty making 
makes it clear that the Crown should not be permitted to unilaterally decide that the benefit s of the 
new use of land it mandated would accrue to others, and not the LS FN. Such unilateral action is 
“the antithesis  of reconciliation and mutual respect.”16 Under Treaty 3, the LS FN was entitled to 
have all of the benefits of the land, which include ec onomic, spiritual and cultural components.  If 
some truly compelling public need requires that LSFN be deprived of its ability to determine the 
use of the land, it was entitled to a n arrangement that would satisfy the requirement that treaty 
partners act in  a mutually respectful and beneficial manner. It is for the loss of that fair and 
respectful arrangement that LSFN must be compensated.   
Remedies must minimize the extent First Nations are deprived of the benefits of their land   
20. The trial judge  held that C anada would have fulfilled its fiduciary obligation to LSFN if it 
had paid fair market value for the land “either through using its power of appropriation or through 
negotiations with LSFN.”17 Indeed, the trial judge said that if Canada had “done better” than 
paying market price for the land “ it is arguable that it would have violated its duty to the citizens 
of Cana da to act in the public interest.”18 The trial judge rejected any assessment of damages based 
on Canada’s failure to negotiate a revenue sharing agreement , in part  on the basis that the LSFN 
would not have been able to bargain for one. And he rejected compensation based on the value of 
the land for hydro -electric purposes because that was inconsistent with the law on expropriatio n 
and because he sa id it would have put LSFN in a better position than it would have been in if the  
Crown had fulfilled its fiduciary obligations in 1929.

21. The CCN respectfully submits that this approach should not be adopted by this Court. 
Given the unique  role and value of First Nations land , and the Crown ’s fiduciary duty to protect 
the myriad of interests  that First Nations have in maintaining their connection to their land, 
appropriate arrangements cannot be limited to providing  compensation based on expropriation 
princip les. Indeed, in most cases, any fair and respectful settlement would require more.  
22. The content  of what would constitute  a fair and respectful arrangement cannot be limited 
by the fact that the First Nation would have exercised very little b argaining power  in its negotiation 
with the Crown.  This would be inconsistent with the very nature of a fiduciary duty. The question 
is not “what would the First Nation have been able to bargain with the Crown?” but rather “what 
was consistent with the Crown’s obligation?”  
23. Nor does the need for the Crown to have regard to the “public interest” mean that it is 
limited to paying the bare minimum required under expropriation law.  The appropriate balance 
between the “public interest ” and the Crown’s fiduciary obligation to th e First Nation may be to 
utilize the land for the public purpose , but to ensure any financial returns generated by the new use 
of the land be given, in whole or in part, to the First Nation.  At the very least, a settlement 
consistent with the Crown’s fiduc iary duty must ensure that a First Nation is able to continue to 
exercise to the same degree any treaty or other rights that require a land base, and that the 
community has the same potential for economic growth and stability as it did prior to the taking.   
24. The trial judge recognized that i n Osoyoos , this Court held that when reserve land is 
expropriated for a public purpose, the Crown has a fiduciary obligation to minimize the negative 
effects of the expropriation on the First Nation.19 The same requirement  that harms be minimized 
should apply whenever a First Nation is deprived of the use of their land for a public purpose. 
Similarly, remedies for the wrongful  taking of reserve land should be aimed at minimiz ing the 
extent to which First Nations are deprive d of the benefits of having use and control of their land.  
25. One method of achieving this is to base compensation on some measure of the value of the 
use of the land as realized by the Crown.  The remedies sought by LSFN  based on revenue sharing 
or on the va lue of the land for hydro-electric uses are consistent with this approach .  
                                                   
19 Southwind FC , paras. 328 and 361; Osoyoos , para. 52.  8 
26. Such remedies are appropriate because they can at least partially restore the relationship
between the benefits produced by the land and the First Nation.  While the benefits are of  a different
kind than were previously being produced, they are still benefits from the land, and the land was
meant to be used to benefit the First Nation.
27. This approach does not “put the claimant in a better position than they would have been
for the bre ach,” or “provide the plaintiff with a windfall amount that bears no relation to the actual
harm suffered.”20 Nor do these kinds of remedies run contrary to any principle that the plaintiff
should only be compensated for losses caused by the breach of fiduc iary duty.
28. It is clear that the Crown’s failure to protect LSFN’s interest in its reserve land has led to
the situation where LSFN no longer receives the benefits being produced from its lands. If the
Crown had effectively protected LSFN’s interests, it would have either prevented the flooding or
put in place an arrangement consistent with the fiduciary obligation and the honour of the Crown.
This would have been aimed at minimally impairing the LSFN’s connection to its land. Ensuri ng
th
at LSFN  received b enefits from its land even if it lost the use of its land is consistent with this.
29. Such an arrangement could no t be in any way exploitive , and the Crown could not have
taken advantage of any imbalance in the bargaining power between itself and the LSFN.  As a
result, the terms of such an agreement should have been consistent with LSFN receiving full
compensation for all future losses, and the Crown paying the highest amount compatible with a
feasible project.  It would never be consistent with the honour of t he Crown for the Crown to take
a First Nation’ s land in order to increase its own revenues or the profits of third parties. To the
extent there were excess financial gains realized in fulfilling a public purpose, those c ould have
been directed to the First  Nation , without impairing the “public purpose” of the taking.
30. In any event, this Court has acknowledged the possibility that  equitable remedies might
improve the beneficiary’s economic situation.  One of the most important policy objectives of trust
law is that a fiduciary must not gain from the breach of its obligation. If the fiduciary’s profit is
greater than the beneficiary’s loss, the profit is a better standard of compensation.21 This is
20 Respondent’s Factum, para. 66.  
21 Moore International (Canada) Ltd. v. Carter , 1984 CanLII 518 (BC CA)  [Moore ], para. 23.  9 
sometimes justified as the “prophylactic purpose” of disgorgeme nt which “ advances the policy of 
equity, even at the expense of a windfall to the wronged beneficiary.”22  
31. Indeed, the unique three -way relationship between Fir st Nations, their land and the Crow n
m
akes it inappropriate to suggest that First Nations receive  a “windfall” when compensation for
the loss of reserve land is based on the value of that land in the hands of the Crown . First Nations’
rights to their land are not held only under a statute or a land registration system devised by the
Crown. First Natio ns have their own legal orders that ground their authority over their lands, a nd
th
e inter -societal law that governs First Nations rights in Canada recognizes that their legal
interests in land are ultimately sourced in their pre -existing sove reignty and t erritoria l rights over
their land.23 The Crown ’s assertion of sovereignty over those territories, which the Crown relies
on to exercise authority over those lands, can only be consistent with the honour of the Crown if
it is reconciled with First Nations’  continuing interest in the land. If the Crown is going to devel op
r
eserve lands for other purposes, sharing the benefits with the First Nation is consistent with a n
ho
nourable treaty partnership .
32. Subsuming the question of compensation into the expropriation framework erases key
concerns  of equity.  Expropriation principles may preclude valuing the lan d based on the unique
use made of it after expropriation, but there is no reason why that limitation must be imported into
the Crown’s fiduciary obligation . In the context of the special fiduciary relationship between th e
C
rown and First Nations, valuing the land as it is actually being used restores the relationshi p
b
etween the First Nation and the benefits flowing from their land, while ensuring that any increas e
in value that results from the fiduciary’s breach finds its way to the beneficiary.  In this manner,
the treaty promise of two peoples moving forward together in partnership can be fulfilled.
33. In Atlantic Lottery , this Court reaffirmed the longstanding use  of gain -based remedies for
breach of fiduciary duty, and held that such remedies may be appropriate in  common law situations
if other remedies are inadequate, and extraordinary circumstances warrant such an award.  24
