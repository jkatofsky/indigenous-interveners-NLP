 PART I:  OVERVIEW AND FACTS  
1. This appeal is about whether one branch of government—the branch that has been 
responsible for some of the most devastating and destructive acts against Indigenous peoples 
throughout Canada’s history—is wholly exempt from “one of the best available legal tools”1 for 
advancing  reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Based on the constitutional principles 
engaged, as well as the authorities of this Court, neither Parliament nor the legislatures are 
exempt from the  national proj ect of reconciliation. Parliamentary sovereignty cannot trump the 
dictate of the Constitution. T he duty to consult must apply to legislative action.  
2. The Manitoba Metis Federation (“M MF”) adopts the facts as set out by the Appellants and 
adds the following:  
(a) This appeal will impact all of the “aboriginal peoples of Canada” included in 
section 35(2) of the Constitution Act , 1982—Indians, Inuit and Métis alike. It is 
not a case that will only affect the “Indian peoples” and their governments 
(i.e., First Nations).  
(b) The Manitoba g overnment already recognizes that the Crown’s duty to consult 
“applies when any proposed provincial law, regulation, decision or action may 
infringe upon or adversely affect the exercise of a treaty or aboriginal rights. ”2 
There is also a history in Manitoba of consultation and co-development of various 
legislative and regulatory initiatives with  Indigenous peoples, including with  the 
MMF.3

 PART II:  ISSUES  
3. The MMF will address the firs t issue in this appeal: does the duty to consult apply to 
legislative action? As detailed further below, the MMF makes submissions that it does. 
PART III:  ARGUMENT  
A. Section 35 Requires  All Branches of Government to Advance Reconciliation —
Legislative Action Cannot Be Immune from the Duty  to Consult 
4. Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 is unique in the world. No other na tion-state has 
fettered its sovereignty —through the constitutional protection and recognition of Aboriginal and 
treaty rights —in the same way.  In 1982, Canada —as a coun try from coast to coa st to coast —
agreed to begin to shake off the shackles of colonialism and start  the long journey of 
reconciliation  with Indigenous peoples. This process is  anchored  on: (1) section 35’s 
constitutional base; (2) legally enforceable and constitutionally protected Aboriginal and treaty 
rights; and, (3) constitutional duties and obligations to guide and smooth the way forward.  
5. Section 35 binds all  of the branches of government  in Canada—the executive branches , 
Parliament and the legislatures , as well as the judiciary —to work together to advance the 
national project  of reconcili ation within their respective spheres  and jurisdictions. Reconcili ation 
is “a process flowing from rights guaranteed by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act , 1982.”4 In order 
for reconcili ation to be advanced, neither Parliament5 nor the legislatures  can be insulated  from 
section 35’s constitutional imperative  or the constitutional principles that animate its operation, 
including the procedural protections provided through the duty to consult.6  
6. An affirmative answer to the fundamental question underlying this appeal —whether the 
duty to consult applies to leg islative action —is required in order to fulfill section 35’s promise. 
The national project of r econciliation would be severely undermined if “cons ultation free zones” 
                                                 
4 Haida Nation v British Columbia  (Minister of Forests ), 2004 SCC 73 at para 32 [ Haida]. 
5 Daniels v Canada ( Indian Affairs and Northern Development ), 2016 SCC 12 at para 37: 
“Reconciliation with  all of Canada’s Aboriginal peoples is Parliament’s  goal.”  
6 Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 SCR 217 at para 48; Beckman v Little 
Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53 at para 42).  3 
 could be arbitrarily established  by members of the executive or bureaucrats , who could simply 
claim their policy related work is “legislative in nature ”7 in order to evade the duty or if the 
“consultation patchwork ” that already exists  (where some jurisdictions already recognize that the 
duty applies to the development of laws  that impact Aboriginal and treaty rights  while 
Parliament and other legislatures do not) becomes a race to the bottom .8 These results would 
thwart reconciliation , not support or advance it.  
7. Moreover, contrary to the Respondents’ submissions, parliamentary sovereignty has 
never been absolute in Canada. Legislation that is adopted in a “manner and  form” that is 
inconsistent with the Constitution will be found to be invalid.9 In these situations, the legislation 
at issue is not declared invalid because an underlying breach of a constitutional right has been 
established or because the legislation is  ultra vires . The legislation  is invalidated because 
procedural protections or processes—mandated by the Constitution —have not been met.10  
                                                 
7 Canada v Mikisew Cree First Nation, 2016 FCA 311 at para 30 [ Mikisew FCA ]. 
8 Consultation on proposed legislation that may adversely impact Aboriginal and treaty rights is 
not an impossible task, and is in fact already undertaken by several provinces and territorial 
governments as a matter of policy. For a review of existing provincial and territorial approaches 
see: Zachary Davis, The Duty to Consult and Legislative Action, Saskatchewan Law Review 
2016 Vol 79 at pp 19–20 [MMF Book of Authorities, Tab 1]. 
9 Peter W Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada, Looseleaf (Scarb orough: Carswell, 2016-R1) at 
12-11; Bribery Commissioner v Ranasinghe , [1964] All ER 785 at 7 ; Gallant v The King, [1949] 
2 DLR 425 at 431; Re Manitoba Language Rights , [1985] 1 SCR 721 at 747.  
10 For example, section 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 (a constitutional provision) requires that 
the Province’s statutes be enacted in both English and French, making bills passed by the legislature in only one of these languages invalid (see Re Manitoba Language Rights at para 45). 
Or, no bill passed by a legislature can have force of law unless it is assented to by the Lieutenant Governor, as royal assent is required by the Constitution ( Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict, 
c3 at ss 55, 90).  4 
 8. In the same way, the duty to consult—as “a constitutional imperative ”11 and “a 
procedural duty  that arise s from the honour of the Crown”12—applies  to legislative action . While 
Parliament and the legislatures reign supreme over their own internal processes, they cannot be 
immune to the dictates of the Constitution , which require that the procedural protections afforded 
to Aboriginal peoples—based on the honour of the Crown and section  35— are met  prior to the 
passage of legislation .  
9. In the same way that the executive branch or an administrative decision-maker needs to 
ensure that the “constitutional imperative ” of the duty has been met or risk having their decision 
declared invalid,13 so too must Parliament and the legislatures. The courts —as the “guardians of 
the Constitution”14—must ensure that legislation is adopted in “manner and form” that is 
consistent with the requirements of the Constitution , including the procedural requirements of 
the duty to consult. If the duty is not met, legislation should be invalidated. This is what is 
required in the age of reconciliation. 
10. Similar to how the duty is determined and assessed in other circumstances, consultation 
requirements will vary depending on the rights and claims at stake and the potential for adverse 
impacts. At the very least , Parliament and the legislatures will need to ensure that government or 
private members demonstr ate consultation has taken plac e where Aboriginal and treaty rights are 
adversely impacted by proposed legislation. This is not an impossible task. As noted above, 
many governments already ensure compliance with this “constitutional imperative ” prior to 
introducing legislation.  Moreover , legislatures  may provide opportunities for impacted 
Aboriginal groups to be heard to ensure the duty is met. Section 35 fettered Parliamentary 
sovereignty; prior to enacting legislation, it must ensure the duty has been discharged.  
                                                 
11 Clyde River ( Hamlet) v Petroleum Geo -Services Inc, 2017 SCC 40 at paras 19, 24: “The duty 
to consult…has both a constitutional and a legal dimension…its constitutional dimension is 
grounded in the honour of the Crown. This principle is in turn enshrined in s. 35(1)….”  
12 Tsilhqot’in Nation v British Columbia, 2014 SCC 44 at para 78.  
13 Clyde River  at para 24. 
14 Manitoba Metis Federation Inc  v Canada, 2013 SCC 14 at para 135, 140 [ MMF]. 5 
 11. As this Court has recently acknowledged, these constitutionally- mandated procedural 
protections do not guarantee a “particular outcome,” however, they ensure Parliament and the 
legislatures are both informed about the scope of the effects of the legislation on Aboriginal and 
treaty rights prior to enacting a law, and are not free to ignore one of “the best available legal 
tools in the reconciliation basket.”15  
B. A Purposive and Contextual Interpretation of Section 35 Leads to the Application of 
the Du ty in Relation to Legislat ive Action  
12. A purposive and contextual interpretation  of section 35 also leads to the application of the 
duty to consult to legislative action . As it has done in the past,16 the Court’s interpretation of 
section 35—based on the unique fact situation in this appeal —must be informed by the honour 
of the Crown, a “generous” and “purposive” reading  of the provision17 and be consistent with the 
linguistic, philosophical, and historical context of section 35.18 
13. Section 35 comes out of an era where any  government legislation  trumped Aboriginal  
rights, including those  rights expressly  protected within treaties or other agreements ( i.e., the 
Natural Resources Transfer Agreements ).19 Even Indian harvesting rights—being exercised on 
reserve lands —were not protected .20 It arose from a time when proposed legislative amendments 
to the Indian Act —which controlled almost every aspect of Indian peoples’ lives from cradle to 
grave—still represented a “dialogue of the deaf” between legislators and First Nations.21

18 Reference re Supreme Court Act , 2014 SCC 21 at para 19; Reference re Senate Reform , 
2014 SCC 32 at para 25 [ Senate Reference].  
19 Sparrow at 1103: “We cannot recount with much pride the treatment accorded to the native 
people of this country.” 
20 R v White  (1964), 50 DLR (2d) 613 (BCCA), affirmed by Supreme Court of Canada at (1965), 
52 DLR (2d) 481; Daniels v White , [1968] SCR 517.  
21 Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples , Volume 1: Looking Forward, Looking 
Back (Canada, October 1996) at 237 (“RCAP”).  6 
 14. For the Métis , section 35 arose from an era where they existed in a “legal lacuna” with  no 
protection for their rights or interests: “[a]lthough widely recognized as a culturally distinct 
Aboriginal people living in culturally distinct communities, the law remained blind to the unique 
history of the Métis and their unique needs.” 22  
15. Simply put, legislative action —through its all-encompassing presence or complete 
absence—represented one of the greatest harms to Indigenous peoples within Canada. This is the 
historic conte xt that informed  the negotiation and adoption of s ection 35. The proposition that 
legislative action would escape scrutiny going forward ignores this history and is antithetical to reconciliation.  
16. While section 35 constitutionally protects “Aboriginal and treaty rights,” it also fetter s, 
and builds  in procedural protections ( i.e., the duty to consult) against, future legislative reach into 
the lives of Indigenous peoples and  the internal affairs of their communities and governments, 
which was so destructiv e in the past . This is why it was heralded  as a “turning point,” and a 
“political watershed” that did “away with the paternalism that [Aboriginal peoples] have often 
felt relative to other Canadians and Canadian institutions.”
23 This is why section 35 right s are 
uniquely beyond the reach of the “notwithstanding clause” in Canada’s Constitution.24 Unilateral 
and indifferent legislative action, without any consultation, was to be a thing of the past. 
17. In Sparrow, this Court first acknowledged that legislative action, post-1982, must uphold 
the honour of the Crown and respect the modern era of Crown-Indigenous relations.25 This Court 
                                                 
22 Alberta (Abori ginal Affair) v Cunningham , 2011 SCC 37 at para 7-8 [ Cunningham ]. 
23 See Canada, Debates of the Senate , 32nd Parl, 1st Sess, No 3 (7 December 1981) at 3317–3318 
(Jean Marchand, P.C) ; Canada, House of Commons  Debates, 32nd Parl, 1st Sess, No 7 
(20 February 1981) at 7520–7521. 
24 Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  does not apply to the rights 
protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982. See Sparrow at 1101–1102. 
25 Sparrow at 1110. 7 
 has further recognized that the honour of the Crown requires Ministers and government officials 
to “conduct themselves with honour when acting on behalf of the sovereign.”26  
18. A refusal to consult on contemplated legislation that adversely affect s constitutionally -
protected Aboriginal or treaty rights is not honourable. It is these types of decisions —made in 
secret or “behind closed doors” —that have “engendered deep suspicions on the part of 
[Aboriginal] people about the ultimate intentions of Canadian policy makers towards them.”27 
This type of approach undermines  the very purpose of section 35 as well as reconciliation’s most 
important and practical work: building trust and renew ing Crown-Indigenous relationships.28 
Consultation on these i ssues must be confirmed as legally enforceable. 
19. In Haida Nation, this Court first recognized the duty to consult as an effective and 
durable constitutional tool to balance the honour of the Crown, future Crown-Indigenous 
relations, and Crown conduct in order to advance section 35’s purpose.29 This appeal requires 
this Court to now apply the duty to contemplated legislative action that adversely impacts 
Aboriginal and treaty rights. This is a modest task , necessary to  ensure no branch of government 
is exempt from the national project of reconciliation.  As noted above, many jurisdictions already 
acknowledge this constitutional requirement.  
20. While the parties may not agree with respect to what legislative action should ultimately 
be taken,30 legislative action by ambush —as seen in this appeal —has no place in the era of 
reconciliation.

 C. An Illusory View of the Sep aration of Powers Cannot Cloak the Exec utive from 
Crown Consultation 
21. Conceiving of the separation of executive and legislative powers as water- tight 
compartments, as urged by the Respondents, distorts how government in Canada actually works: 
“[t]he separation of powers is not a rigid and absolute structure. The Court should not be blind to 
the reality of Canadian governance that, except in certain rare cases, the executive frequently 
and de facto controls the legislature.”31 
22. In Canada, “true executive power lies in the Cabinet”32 and “legislative bodies have little 
real influence in policy -making.”33 Indeed, making the policy decisions that lie behind the 
government’s legislative agenda is among the executive’s most important functions. An 
approach that allows the executive to potentiall y insulate itself against the duty by deeming all 
policy development work that may adversely impact Aboriginal or treaty rights as “legislative in nature”
34 is unworkable and runs the risk of allowing the executive to unilaterally neuter the 
duty—with no ju dicial supervision.  
23. The executive must not be allowed to cloak its actions in legislative cloth to evade its 
constitutional responsibilities to Aboriginal people. “All executive powers, whether they derive from statute, common law or prerogative, must be adapted to conform with constitutional 
imperatives.”
35 Once triggered, the duty to consult must be discharged36—even by Cabinet, and 
even when Cabinet’s decisions are upstream in  the legislative process.  
D. Legislative Recognition and Implementation of Abor iginal Self -Government 
Requires Crown Consultation 
24. While the MMF recognizes that this  appeal is not about Aboriginal self-government, the 
Court should be aware that a complete denial of the duty to consult in relation to proposed

 legislative action  will have negative implications  on ongoing self -government negotiations as 
well as the future implementation —through legislation —of these negotiated agreements .  
25. This Court, as well as the federal government , has recognized that Aboriginal  peoples 
have an inherent right to self-government, though the contours of this right require definition on 
a case-by-case basis .37 Some courts have also recognized that Aboriginal self-government is 
“akin to a legislative power to make laws, survived as one of the unwritten ‘underlying values’ 
of the Constitution outside of the powers distributed to Parliament and the legislatures in 1867”38 
and that “[t]hese subsisting [self-government] rights curtailed the powers of colonial governments, just as they later curtailed the powers of Parliament and the legislative 
assemblies.”
39 
26. Despite varying interpretations on the legal basis and scope of Aboriginal self -
government rights , it is common ground that these issues are ideally dealt with through 
negotiation s. Modern- day treaty or self-government agreement negotiations provide the 
necessary space for the recognition of Indigenous jurisdictions and governance. Such 
arrangements , however, ultimately require legislative action to give  them full legal force and 
effect. In order to maintain trust and good faith, consultation on implementation legislation is 
commonplace and even built into many agreements. G iven the issues at stake,  however, 
consultation on this type of legislation cannot be discretionary or merely good policy practice.

It is constitutionally required based on the  honour of the Crown, section 35,  and the fact that 
modern-day Aboriginal self- government arrangements weave together federal, provincial , and 
Indigenous jurisdictions.40  
27. The history and legacy of the Indian Act  provides the cautionary tale on why consultation 
on Aboriginal self-government legislation is required. Section 35 must act as a shield to protect 
Aboriginal self -government during  the legislative process, not merely a sword to challenge parts 
of legislation ‘after -the-fact.’ The recognition of the duty in this context is fundamental to the 
continuing the  advancement of  Aboriginal self-government and modern day treaty- making. 
While at this moment in time, it would be unthinkable to many that a replication of an Indian 
Act-like piece of legislation could occur , without legal certainty and protection to this effect—
which the recognition of the duty in the context of proposed legislative action would provide—
section 35’s constitutional promise could ring hollow in the future.  
PART IV:  COSTS  
28. The MMF  does not seek costs and ask s that costs not be awarded against it in this appeal.
