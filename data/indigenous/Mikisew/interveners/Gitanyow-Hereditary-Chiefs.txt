I. OPENING STATEMENT  
 
1. This appeal, fundamentally, is about respect  and relationships.  
 
2. This appeal  addresses whether the Crown is able to alter or introduce legislation and 
implement changes that would affect the rights of Indigenous peoples without consultation . 
 
3. Over the last three decades, this Court has given shape  to the Crown -Aboriginal relationship , 
acknowledg ing that: 
a. “For many years, the rights of the Indians to their a boriginal lands -- certainly as legal  
rights -- were virtually ignored .”1 
b. “In all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples, from the assertion of sovereignty to the 
resolution of claims and the implementation of treaties, the Crown must act honourably . 
Nothing less is  required if we are to achieve “ the reconciliation of the pre -existence of 
aboriginal societies wit h the sovereignty of the Crown .”2 
c. There is a “special” relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Crown .3  
 
4. Guided by this Court,  the Crown -Aboriginal relationship has  evolved; h owever,  its 
boundaries remain undefined . Aboriginal peoples are  caught between the Crown’s repeated 
confirmation of th is special relationship , and the Crown’ s assertion  that Aboriginal peoples  
do not have rights beyond those of other Canadians . The Crown give s assurances to 
Indigenous peoples with one hand, while clawing back their rights with the other.  
 
5. This Court has stated that “[c]onsultation is, after all, ‘ [c]oncerned with an  ethic of ongoing 
relationships .’”4 The Crown , aided by the courts,  should no longer be allowed to 
paternalistically and unilaterally decide the terms of the relationship.

II. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
 
6. The Gitanyow adopt the facts as presented by the Appellants.  
 
7. The Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs are an Aboriginal people  under s. 35 of the Constitution 
Act, 1982.  Justice Neilson (as she then was) in Wii’lits wx v. British Columbia  described t he 
Gitanyow’s traditional governance and social structure and lands management  system . 
Neilson, J. found that the Gitanyow are organized matrilineally by Wilp, or house  group , 
which “are the social, political and governing units of the Gitanyow.”5 
 
8. The Gitanyow do not have a treaty. In the absence of a treaty, the Gitanyow  have entered 
into Recognition and Reconciliation agreements with the Crown to  build on the Crown -
Gitanyow relationship so as to guide land and natural resource management for the benefit 
of both parties.6  
 
III. STATEMENT OF ISSUES  
 
9. The Gitanyow a ccept the issues as stated by the Appellant s and will address the  first issue . 
The Gitanyow’s position is that Canada is not free to draft or amend legislation that could 
affect the constitutionally protected rights of Aboriginal peoples without consultation.  
 
IV. STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT  
 
10. This case addresses  the nature of  the Crown’s relationship with Aboriginal people.  While 
Canada  represents that it respects this relationship , it denies  its special nature  when it views 
Aboriginal peoples a s asking for too much.  
 
11. In the absence of a formal treaty, the Gitanyow are required to work within the “special 
relationship” with an honourable Crown, while also not infrequently colliding with the 
Crown’s imposed limitations on that relationship.  
                                                           
5 Wii’litswx  v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2008 BCSC 1139 , at para. 21 [ Wii’litswx ] 
6 Ibid., at paras. 67 -85 3 
 
12. For non -treaty Aboriginal nati ons such as the Gitanyow, allowing this appeal is critical to 
safeguard the integrity of existing agreements with the Crown, and ensure the  value of 
creating future agreements .  
 
13. The Gitanyow  agreements with the Crown are the result of years of work and compromise, 
sometimes with the aid of the c ourts ,7 to find ways for the Gitanyow to protect their “social, 
political and governing” system. This is reconciliation in action.8  
 
14. If the Crown can unilaterally amend  or introduce  legislation that affects  its agreements with  
Aboriginal peoples, the ir trust in the Crown’s in good faith is misguided . Aboriginal nations 
which  rely on non -treaty agreements with the Crown will have little  motivation to enter into 
such agreements.  
A. Real Reconciliation in the Crown -Aboriginal  Relationship Requires Respectful 
Consultation and  Accommodation  
 
15. The duty to consult stems from s. 35 and the reality that Aboriginal societies existed  in what 
is now Canada  prior to the assertion of Crown sovereignty, and continue to exist today.9  
 
16. Aboriginal peoples routinely experience the rhetoric of reconciliation and nation -to-nation 
relationship building, but find that the Cro wn is quick to attempt to ‘put A boriginal peoples 
in their place’ when their expectations go beyond what the Crown is either comfortable with 
or perceives as reasonable.   
 
17. Justice Hughes in his Federal Court decision found that:  
…there is no special provision in Treaty No. 8 that characterizes the law-
making  process as Crown actions that would allow the Mikisew, in preference 
to other Canadians , to intervene in the legislative process before a bill that 
                                                           
7 Ibid.; Gitxs an and other First Nations v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) , 2002 BCSC 
1701;  Gitanyow First Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) , 2004 BCSC 1734  
8 Wii’litsxw, supra note 5, at paras. 36 -67 
9 Haida,  supra  note 2, at para. 32  4 
 
may, in some arguable way, i nterfere with the Mikisew’s treaty rights of 
fishing and trapping.10 (emphasis added)  
 
18. The Crown argue s: 
If this Court were to recognize a duty to consult the appellants on legislation, 
such recognition would create a hierarchy of consultation. Those whose 
Charter rights are abridged by legislation would have no right of consultation 
on legislation; however, Indigenous groups under s. 35 would have such a 
right of consultation. If Charter rights cannot be protected by the courts during 
the legislative proces s, it would seem inconsistent for rights flowing from s. 
35 of the Constitution Act to be a basis for overturning parliamentary 
sovereignty.11 
 
19. This argument contradicts  reconciliation , thereby undermining the  purpose of s. 35 (which is 
distinct from the  Charter ), to reconcile the pre -existence of Aboriginal societies with the 
assertion of Crown sovereignty.  
 
20. Contrary to its stated goal of reconciliation with Aboriginal peoples,  and the directions of 
this Court , the Crown argues that Aboriginal peoples in Canada  should not have rights 
beyond  those of other Canadians . The Crown is telling Aboriginal peoples that the  Crown -
Aboriginal  relationship is special and requir es deference  only when such deference does not 
interfere with Crown  objectives  or the Crown power to legislate .  
 
21. The Crown , in effect,  argues that it alone can define the limits of the ‘special’ Crown -
Aboriginal relationship  and can  propose legislation  that limits Aboriginal rights with 
impunity . This approach  mimics the Crown’s  earlier paternalistic  colonial policies . In this 
case, the Crown wants the Court to endorse th is positio n by barring Aboriginal peoples  from 
access to consultation on legislation that could affect  their s. 35 rights.  
 
22. True reconciliation, based on a nation -to-nation relationship grounded in respect cannot exist 
when one party can unilaterally limit the terms of that relationship an d exert its authority over 
the other.

para. 71

B. Ongoing Relations – Future Treaties and Agreements  
 
23. As held by this court in Beckman : 
The reconciliation of Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal Canadians in a mutually 
respectful long -term relationship is the grand purpose of  s. 35  of 
the Constitution Act, 1982 .  The modern treaties, including those at issue here, 
attempt to further the objective of reconciliation not only by addressing 
grievances over the land claims but by creating the legal basis to foster a 
positive long -term relationship between Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal 
communities.   Thoughtful administration of the treaty will help manage, 
even if it fails to eliminate, some of the misunderstandings and grievances 
that have characterized the past.   Still, as the facts of this case show, the treaty 
will not accomplish its purpose if it is interpreted by territorial officials in an 
ungenerous manner or as if it were an everyday commercial contract.   The 
treaty is as much about building relationships as it is about the settlement 
of ancient grievances.   The future is more important than the past.   A 
canoeist who hopes to make progress faces forwards, not backwards.12 
(emphasis added)  
 
24. Making agreements with the C rown, to date, has been the only  way for the Gitanyow and 
other non -treaty Aboriginal peoples to implement a nation -to-nation relationship. To that 
end, these agreements represent the Gitanyow’s best attempts at reconciliation.  
 
25. This Court has repeatedly encouraged Crown -Aboriginal agreements over litigation, stating 
“[t]rue reconciliation is rarely, if ever, achieved in courtrooms.”13 
 
26. It is clear that  from the outset of its consideration of Aboriginal rights,  this Court 
contemplated that consultation would be afforded to Aboriginal peoples whose rights could 
be affected by  proposed legislation or amen dments to legislation:  
By giving aboriginal rights constitutional status and priority, Parliament and 
the provinces have sanctioned challenges to social and economic policy 
objectives embodied in legislation to the extent that aboriginal rights are 
affecte d. Implicit in this constitutional scheme is the obligation of the 
legislature to satisfy the test of justification. The way in which a legislative 
objective is to be attained must uphold the honour of the Crown and must be 
in keeping with the unique conte mporary relationship, grounded in history 
and policy, between the Crown and Canada’s aboriginal peoples. The extent 
                                                           
12 Beckman , supra  note 3, at para. 10  
13 Clyde River , supra  note 4, at para. 24  6 
 
of legislative or regulatory impact on an existing aboriginal right may be 
scrutinized so as to ensure recognition and affirmation.14 (emphas is 
added)  
 
27. The British Columbia Court of Appeal has held that  “claims of failure to  consult  and 
accommodate [are] upstream not only of the certificate of indefeasible title but also of the 
statutes under which the ministerial power has been exercised. ”15 If claims for inadequate 
consultation are “upstream” of statutes, it would logically follow that consultation must 
extend to  pre-tabling discussion of  legislation  that may impact Aboriginal rights . 
 
28. In Haida Nation , this Court  held: 
…the Province has a duty to consult and perhaps accommodate on T.F.L. 
decision. The T.F.L. decision reflects the strategic planning for utilization of 
the resource. Decisions made during strategic planning may have 
potentially serious impacts on Aboriginal rights and title.16 (emphasis 
added)  
 
29. The introduction or amendment of legislation is the highest form of  “strategic planning”. 
Legislation represents a strategic plan to achieve Canada’s ‘social and economic policy 
objectives’. Excluding Aboriginal people s from consultation when considering how to 
implement those ‘objectives’ in law makes the Crown -Aboriginal goal of reconciliation 
hollow . 
 
30. If the Crown is permitted to repeal, amend, or introduce legislation which impacts 
unextinguished Aboriginal rights without consultation, it will mean that the Crown’s repeated 
assurances of the ‘special nature’ of the Crown -Aboriginal relationship are specious.  
 
31. There is a conflict between the Crown’s commitment to advance the goal of reconciliation 
through the creatio n of Crown -Aboriginal  agreements, and its asserted  ability to significantly

2005 BCCA 128 , at para. 19  
16 Haida Nation, supra  note 2, at para. 76  7 
 
impact the se agreements  without any consultation. Allowing Crown actions of this nature 
would suggest to the Gitanyow that the last 20 years’ work towards reconciliation is futile . 
 
32. The Crown could  gut agreements with the Gitanyow by legislative means wit h no obligation 
to consult with and accommodate the Gitanyow regarding  impacts on Gitanyow rights. Such 
an outcome is the antithesis of reconciliation and implicitly upholds  bad faith negotiations.17 
 
33. Furthermore,  the content of  legislation can impact  what the Crown will consult Aboriginal 
people about, and the extent of  the accommodation measures it is willing to provide.18  
 
34. If Aboriginal peoples are not consulted on legislat ion that delineates the extent of Crown 
consultation and accommodation, the effect is that the Crown can set its own boundaries for 
consultation and accommodation, and then rely on these boundaries to limit the consultation 
and accommodation provided.  
 
35. As this Court has stated:  
Finally, the  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
(the UNDRIP ), was endorsed by Canada on November 12, 2010.  …. Although 
this international instrument is, at the time being, a declaration and not a treaty 
or a covenant, and is not legally binding except to the extent that some of its 
provisions reflect customary international law, when Canada endorsed it, it 
reaffirmed its commitment to “…improve the well -being of Aboriginal 
Canadians .”19 (citation removed)  
 
36.  The UN Declaration contains the following provision:  
Indigenous  peoples have the right to maintain and develop their political, 
economic and social systems or institutions20, to be secure in the enjoyment 
of their own means of subsistence and development, and to engage freely in 
all their traditional and other economic activities.21

37. Canada, in committing to the UN Declaration, recognized that its duty to Aboriginal 
peoples extends to supporting them in "maintaining their political, economic and social 
systems or institutions ... ". It cannot meaningfully do this if it insists on excluding them 
from any consultation regarding proposed laws or regulations that will impact those 
systems and institutions. 
38. The Crown-Aboriginal relationship, combined with the requirement for the Crown to 
conduct itselfhonourably, creates a reality where Aboriginal peoples have special rights not 
enjoyed by non-Aboriginal Canadians. If the Crown-Aboriginal relationship is indeed 
special and meaningful, reconciliation demands courage, and a willingness to listen and 
change. 
V. SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS 
39. The Gitanyow do not seek costs and request that none be awarded against them. 
VI. ORDER SOUGHT 
40. The Gitanyow ask that this Court grant the relief sought by the Appellants.
