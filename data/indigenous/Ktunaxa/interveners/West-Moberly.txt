1. The West Moberly First Nations and Prophet River First Nation (the "Treaty 8 Nations") 
adopt the facts set out in the Appellant's factum. 
PART II -POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPELLANT'S QUESTIONS 
2. While the Treaty 8 Nations generally support the positions advanced by the Appellants, 
they focus their submissions on two areas: 1) the legal requirements imposed on decision­
making bodies when constitutional rights are alleged to be infringed by a statutory 
decision; and 2) that spiritual and cultural practices are manifestations of Indigenous 
Laws which are themselves Aboriginal rights, dependent upon specific places. 
PART III-STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT 
3. Aboriginal rights find their source not in a magic moment of European contact, but in the 
traditional laws and customs of the aboriginal people in question. These Indigenous laws 
in relation to land are relevant to establishing the occupation of Aboriginal title lands. 
R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 ["Van der Peet"] at para. 247 [ABOA, tab 29]. 
Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010 at para 148 [ABOA, tab 10]. 
4. "[T]he doctrine of aboriginal rights exists, and is recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1) , 
because of one simple fact: when Europeans arrived in North America, aboriginal 
peoples were already here, living in communities on the land, and participating in 
distinctive cultures, as they had done for centuries. It is this fact, and this fact above all 
others, which separates aboriginal peoples from all other minority groups in Canadian 
society and which mandates their special legal, and now constitutional, status." 
Van der Peet at para. 30 [ABOA, tab 29]. 
5. This court has repeatedly stated that reconciliation is the underlying goal when 
addressing Aboriginal and Treaty rights. 
R. v. Gladstone, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 723 at para. 73[Treaty 8 Book of Authorities 
(T8 BOA), tab 4]. 
Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 
[2005] 3 S.C.R. 388, 2005 SCC 69, at para. 1 [T8 BOA, tab 1]. 2 
6. It is the application of these principles that should govern the disposition of this appeal. 
Duty to Decide Infringement 
7. Whether one is dealing with Charter rights or section 35 rights there is a positive duty on 
statutory decision-makers to ensure that their decisions are constitutionally compliant. 
Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038 at pp. 1077-1078 
[ABOA, tab 48]. 
Dore v. Barreau du Quebec, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395 ["Dore"'] at paras. 35 & 56 
[ABOA, tab 11]. 
Beckman v. Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53 
["Beckman"] at paras. 47-48 [ABOA, tab 4]. 
8. The principle of constitutional supremacy applies to all statutory decisions that 
potentially impact upon section 3 5 or Charter rights. 
9. In the context of section 3 5 rights such duties to Aboriginal peoples lie "upstream" of the 
statutory mandate of the decision-maker. 
West Moberly First Nations v. British Columbia (Chief Inspector of Mines), 
2011 BCCA 247 ["West Moberly"] at para. 106 [T8 BOA, tab 6]. 
Musqueam Indian Band v. British Columbia, 2005 BCCA 128 at paras 18-19 
[T8 BOA, tab 2]. 
10. Ensuring that statutory decision-makers inquire whether their decisions are 
constitutionally compliant is consistent with the underlying purposes of consultation, 
which requires Aboriginal rights to be identified, protected and preserved. The Crown's 
approach to consultation must be focussed on avoiding unjustifiable infringements of 
Charter, Aboriginal and Treaty rights.

[ABOA, tab 45].

Beckman at para. 53 [ABOA, tab 4]. 
R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103 [ABOA, tab 35]. 3 
11. Unlike administrative tribunals who are constrained by their enabling statute, statutory 
decision-makers, including Ministers, have a "duty to decide" constitutional issues that 
are raised in the context of proceedings before them. In this case, the statutory decision­
maker did not decide the Charter issue. 
12. However, the law does not allow decision-makers simply to declare that considerations of 
infringements of constitutional rights are "out of scope" or that the claim is weak and 
therefore need not be addressed in their reasons for decision. 
13. The failure of a statutory decision-maker to consider matters of Charter and Aboriginal 
rights infringement risks the unlawfulness of untrammelled discretion that this court 
warned against in Adams: 
In light of the Crown's unique fiduciary obligations towards aboriginal peoples, 
Parliament may not simply adopt an unstructured discretionary administrative 
regime which risks infringing aboriginal rights in a substantial number of 
applications in the absence of some explicit guidance. If a statute confers an 
administrative discretion which may carry significant consequences for the 
exercise of an aboriginal right, the statute or its delegate regulations must outline 
specific criteria for the granting or refusal of that discretion which seek to 
accommodate the existence of aboriginal rights. 
R. v. Adams, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 101 ["Adams"] at para. 54[T8 BOA, tab 3]. 
14. Parties seeking to challenge the lawfulness of statutory decisions must proceed by 
judicial review. As the judicial review is based on the record that was before the decision­
maker, as a general rule a party must not raise an issue for the first time on judicial 
review. Once raised, and absent a statutory bar, the decision-maker is obliged to decide 
constitutional issues, which allows the reviewing court with a full record and reasons, 
rather than searching for possible explanations or post-hoc justification. 
Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers' Association, 
2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 654 at paras. 22-26 (Minister of Forests Book of 
Authorities [MF BOA], tab 1). 
15. In British Columbia, the Supreme Court Rules provide that their object "is to secure the 
just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding on its merits." The 
integration of section 35 and Charter analysis into administrative decision-making fulfills 4 
the object of the Rules and provides parties with timely access to justice, rather than 
having to launch multiple court proceedings. 
Supreme Court Civil Rules, B.C. Reg. 168/2009, Rule 1-3. 
Spiritual & Cultural Sites are Manifestations of Aboriginal Rights 
16. Aboriginal and Treaty rights are more than rights simpliciter; they require specific 
preferred places that often hold cultural and spiritual significance to the First Nation. The 
destruction of cultural and spiritual cites substantially interferes with the meaningful 
exercise of rights, which is integral to First Nations' ability to participate in their 
Aboriginal practices, customs or traditions. 
17. In Cote, this court recognized that it is not the mere act of fishing that defines an 
Aboriginal right, but that there is a cultural importance of the right to fish and the 
incidental rights to teach such a practice, custom and tradition to the younger generation. 
This holistic approach to Aboriginal rights is demanded by the jurisprudence. 
R. v. Cote, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 139 at para. 56 [ABOA, tab 31]. 
18. These 'sacred' section 35 rights and section 2(a) Charter rights are inextricably linked. 
Aboriginal rights and religion or spiritualism operate in a symbiotic relationship that 
forms the distinctive, pre-European contact culture of the First Nations. 
19. The approach of the lower courts was that they were not prepared to recognize that 
Aboriginal spiritual practices could occur in one place in relation to a sacred place 
elsewhere or that such practices were subject to the protection of section 2(a) of the 
Charter. This approach is troubling because this perspective is inconsistent with the 
Charter jurisprudence of this court, but it also fails to consider the Aboriginal 
perspective.

[ ABOA, tab 50]. 
Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia, 2014 SCC 44 ["Tsilhqot'in"] at para. 35 [ABOA, 
tab 51]. 5 
20. The well-known religions of the Western world identify sacred places where people go to 
worship -eg. church, synagogue, mosque. The preservation of those places is well 
understood because those locations are where people congregate to engage in their 
respective spiritual practices. In many Aboriginal cultures, the opposite is often true. 
21. In First Nations' culture, certain sacred places are specific locations which are known but 
are to be avoided and are not to be visited. The spiritual practices occur away from those 
locations. Congregating at those sacred locations would be contrary to their spiritual 
practices. 
22. Oftentimes, there are complex Indigenous laws relating to spiritual sites and their 
locations. Members are prohibited from identifying the exact locations of these spiritual 
sites to preserve sacred sites from being despoiled by third parties or development. 
Impact of Destruction of Cultural & Spiritual Sites 
23. The destruction of cultural and spiritual sites has a devastating effect on Aboriginal 
peoples that cannot be understated. "Spiritual Places are destroyed and with them 
opportunities to pass along cultural knowledge become fewer." 
Marc V. Fonda "Are they like us yet? Some thoughts on why religious freedom remains 
elusive for Aboriginals in North America" (2011) 2:4 The International Indigenous 
Policy Journal at p. 2 [ABOA, tab 70]. 
24. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission report characterized the history of Crown­
First Nations relations as one of cultural genocide: 
Cultural genocide is the destruction of those structures and practices that allow the 
group to continue as a group. States that engage in cultural genocide set out to 
destroy the political and social institutions of the targeted group. Land is seized, 
and populations are forcibly transferred and their movement is restricted. 
Languages are banned. Spiritual leaders are persecuted, spiritual practices are 
forbidden, and objects of spiritual value are confiscated and destroyed. 
Summary of the Final Report o/The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 
(2015), Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future ["Summary Report"] at p. 1 
[T8 BOA, tab 9]. 6 
25. In spite of this troubled history, Indigenous laws and customs persist in Aboriginal 
communities. The rules which make up Indigenous Laws govern the observance of 
sacred ritual and economic activity: they maintain social order and dictate the minutiae of 
everyday life. "Land, language, culture, and identity are inseparable from spirituality; all 
are necessary elements of a whole way of being, ofliving on the land as Indigenous 
peoples." 
The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (2015), 
Vol. 6, "Canada's Residential Schools: Reconciliation" at pages, 102-103 
[T8 BOA, tab 10]. 
26. Courts have recognized that the exercise of religious rights and customs have a territorial 
aspect to them. Such rights will attract a duty of consultation when the Crown 
contemplates an action that will adversely affect or infringe upon these Aboriginal and 
Treaty rights. 
Sioui v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1025 ["Sioui"] [T8 BOA, tab 5]. 
Halfway River First Nation v. British Columbia, 1999 BCCA 470 at para. 187 [GR BA, tab 9]. 
27. In most circumstances, the exercise of these spiritual and cultural rights will also give rise 
to Charter considerations. Freedom of religion may be tied to a particular piece of land. 
As this court stated in Sioui: "[f]or a freedom to have real value and meaning, it must be 
possible to exercise it somewhere." 
Sioui at 1067 [T8 BOA, tab 5]. 
28. The approach of the lower courts was that the First Nation could simply "go elsewhere" 
to practice their religion. This is often the approach that courts take in consultation cases 
as well. Such an approach fails to appreciate the significance of sacred places in the 
exercise of Aboriginal rights and Indigenous spirituality according to the Indigenous laws 
of the Aboriginal community in question. As more of these places are "taken up" by 
development, the persistence of Indigenous social order and norms continues to be 
eroded. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has well-documented the devastation 
that such erosion on Indigenous communities. This erosion should not be justifiable 
under s.35(1) or s.1 of the Charter. 7 
29. In the Lafontaine case, Justice Lebel (in dissent) held that if the state makes it impossible 
to exercise or substantially interferes with one's freedom there may be a positive duty on 
government to put an end to the interference with the Charter right. The example that 
Justice Lebel used was a situation where a municipality exercised its zoning bylaw power 
in such a manner that the appellants could not establish their place of worship. 
Congregation des Temoins de Jehovah de St-Jerome-Lafontaine v. Lafontaine (Village), 
[2004] 2 S.C.R. 650, 2004 SCC 48 ["Lafontaine"] at paras. 77-78 [ABOA, tab 8]. 
30. There is no dispute that the destruction of a church, synagogue or a mosque would be an 
unjustified infringement of the freedom of religion. The desecration of a sacred mountain 
should attract similar considerations. Whether the members of that Nation attend to the 
mountain to perform "religious rites" is irrelevant to the analysis whether there has been 
an infringement of s. 2(a) of the Charter. Muslims pray toward Mecca, yet most are 
never are able to visit it. The analysis must have reference to the Indigenous perspective, 
through the Indigenous laws, and not a non-Indigenous definition of a sacred place. 
A Proposed Approach to Reconciling Section 35 & Charter Rights 
31. The proper approach when dealing with Charter rights and Aboriginal rights is one of 
respect for the Indigenous laws and customs that inform these rights. 
32. Section 35 rights, like Charter rights are not static; they can evolve over time. Professor 
Slattery puts the matter this way, in reference to the Haida and Taku River decisions: 
... the Court attributes a generative role to section 35. In effect, it holds that the 
Crown, with the assistance of the courts, has the duty to bring into being a new 
legal order that accommodates Aboriginal rights, through negotiation and 
agreement with the indigenous peoples affected. This approach views section 3 5 
as serving a dynamic and not simply static function -a function that does not 
come to an end even when treaties are successfully negotiated. 
Brian Slattery, "Aboriginal Rights and the Honour of the Crown" (2005) 
29 S.C.L.R. (2d) 433.at p. 440 [T8 BOA, tab 7]. 
33. The Honour of Crown therefore imposes a positive duty to ensure that these 
constitutional rights are protected and preserved. Far too often third party commercial 
interests are preferred to protecting the constitutional rights of First Nations. 8 
34. Chief Justice Lamer's judgment foreshadows this approach in Adams: 
As with limitations of the rights enshrined in the Charter, limits on the aboriginal 
rights protected bys. 35(1) must be informed by the same purposes which 
underlie the decision to entrench those rights in the Constitution to be 
justifiable ... Those purposes are the recognition of the prior occupation of North 
America by aboriginal peoples, and the reconciliation of prior occupation by 
aboriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty. 
Adams at para. 57 [T8 BOA, tab 3]. 
35. The approach of statutory decision-makers must be one that is cognizant and respectful of 
the Charter rights and Aboriginal rights of First Nations. The goal is the reconciliation of 
First Nations' rights with those of the broader community. Importantly, any limitations 
on those rights must be consistent with the purposes with which those rights are 
entrenched in the Constitution. 
36. The Crown has the onus of justifying infringements of these rights and in some cases it 
imposes a significant burden. The recognition of Aboriginal spirituality as Indigenous 
law, subject to section 35 and Charter protection does not "open the floodgates". 
Statutory decision-makers and the courts are well-equipped to distinguish between 
dubious claims and those which have merit. They key is not, as the decision-maker in 
this case did, simply ignore or mischaracterize the nature of the First Nations' claims. 
37. What is critical is a serious dialogue and negotiation around the reconciliation of 
Aboriginal claims and Charter rights. 
Simply put, the challenge is this: how is one to justly and fairly assess how to 
respond to beliefs and practices that come from a way of understanding and being 
in the world that is profoundly foreign to one's own and, perhaps, to most with 
which one has come into contact? This question poses the essential struggle of 
religious freedom in a constitutional democracy. 
Benjamin L. Berger, "Section 1, Constitutional Reasoning and Cultural Difference: 
Assessing the Impacts of Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony" (2010) 51 
S.C.L.R. (2d) at p. 41 [ABOA, tab 67]. 
38. The same challenges with freedom ofreligion are at play in considering Aboriginal and 
treaty rights. In certain circumstances, it may be that the state's interest in economic 9 
development must give way to the Aboriginal constitutional rights. In appropriate 
circumstances, the Crown may have a positive duty to ensure that Aboriginal peoples 
have the sacred space to allow them to exercise their constitutional rights. Protecting and 
preserving the meaningful exercise of these rights is animating purpose of consultation 
and reconciliation. 
39. By the decision-maker not addressing the First Nations claims the reviewing court is left 
to construct reasons for the decision-maker's rejection of the s. 2(a) claim. First Nations 
may also be forced to pursue claims of infringement in parallel actions as decision­
makers claim that they have no jurisdiction to entertain such claims. This approach was 
soundly rejected in Beckman, where Justice Binnie stated: 
The parties in this case proceeded by way of an ordinary application for judicial 
review. Such a procedure was perfectly capable of taking into account the 
constitutional dimension of the rights asserted by the First Nation. There is no 
need to invent a new "constitutional remedy". Administrative law is flexible 
enough to give full weight to the constitutional interests of the First Nation. 
Moreover, the impact of an administrative decision on the interest of an 
Aboriginal community, whether or not that interest is entrenched in as. 35 right, 
would be relevant as a matter of procedural fairness, just as the impact of a 
decision on any other community or individual (including Larry Paulsen) may be 
relevant. [emphasis added] 
Beckman at para. 47 [ABOA, tab 4]. 
40. While the Charter right and section 35 right are different rights with different tests for 
infringement, although post-Tsilhqot 'in the justification standards are similar, the 
fundamental question in either circumstance is whether the statutory decision reflects a 
proportionate balancing between the severity of the impacts on the rights and the 
statutory objectives, informed by the constitutional values at stake. 
Lafontaine at para. 78 [ABOA, tab 8]. 
West Moberly at para. 148[T8 BOA, tab 6]. 
41. The principle of proportionality is a common thread for the review of statutory decisions 
that engage constitutional questions, whether under the Charter or section 35 of the 
Constitution. Balance and proportionality are the key considerations when the state 
proposes to exercise its power to infringe constitutional rights. 10 
Dore at paras. 5-6 [ABOA, tab 11]. 
Tsilqhot'in at para. 82 [ABOA, tab 51]. 
42. Applying the proportionality analysis as a principled and structured basis for judicial 
review leads to predictable and just outcomes. 
Joseph Arvay, Sean Hem & Alison Latimer, "Proportionality and the Public Law" (2015) 
28 Can J. Admin. L. & Prac. 23. at p. 7 [T8 BOA, tab 8]. 
43. Unfortunately, in this case, the decision-maker failed to determine whether his approval 
would infringe the Appellants Charter rights, let alone whether such infringement could 
be justified. Under the circumstances, the remedy is to have the matter sent back to the 
decision-maker to consider the Aboriginal spiritual practice in accordance with the 
Aboriginal perspective and the Charter values at stake.
