A. Overview 
1. This appeal (the "Appeal") raises the critical issue of the nature and scope of the s. 2(a) Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the "Charter") right to freedom of religion and conscience, 1 and in 
particular, how this should be understood in the context of a First Nation claimant with spiritual 
connections to a sacred site. 
2. Katzie hopes that its submission will help the Court: (1) understand the nature and scope of the 
s. 2(a) right in the context of First Nation claimants with spiritual connections to sacred sites, including 
the need to concretely protect the "belief' inherent in the s. 2(a) right; and (2) meaningfully balance the 
values that underlie both the s. 2(a) right and the statutory objective in question at the balancing stage. 
B. Facts: Katzie First Nation, its sacred site, and the issues Katzie will address 
3. Katzie is a First Nation from British Columbia, with over 500 members.2 Development currently 
threatens Katzie's creation site, Sheridan Hill. In response, Katzie has asserted its s. 2(a) right to preserve 
this site and ensure that Katzie spirituality can be meaningfully passed on to future generations.3 The 
outcome of this case will therefore have a significant impact on Katzie. In particular, the outcome of 
issues (b) and (c), as set out at paragraph 42 of the Appellant's factum will have a signifigant impact on 
Katzie's spirituality and culture as it relates to Sheridan Hill. 
PART II. ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED 
4. Katzie's submissions address the following issues, as set out at paragraph 42 of the Appellant's 
factum: whether the Appellant's s. 2(a) right was infringed by the Minister's decision (Issue (b)); and 
whether the Minister's decision reflects a proportionate balancing of the right and the statutory objective 
(Issue (c)).4 Katzie's conclusions are the same as those of the Appellant (yes to Issue (b) and no to Issue 
(c)), although for different reasons. 
PART III. STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT 
A. Section 2(a) must protect the "belier' as well as the "act" 
5. Katzie submits that the Appellant's s. 2(a) right was infringed by the Minister's decision (Issue 
1 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada 
Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11 [Charter]. 
2 Affidavit of Susan Miller (sworn August 4, 2016) at para 4, Katzie First Nation Motion Record for Leave to 
Intervene, Tab 2. 
3 Ibid at paras 5-11. 
4 Factum of the Appellant Ktunaxa Nation Council (dated July 5, 2016) at para 42 [Ktunaxa Factum]. 2 
(b)). More specifically, and as set out below, the refusal to protect Ktunaxa's sacred site deprived the 
Nation of its ability to "believe" in its spirituality, and hence deprived it of the full scope of the s. 2(a) 
protections afforded to other Canadians. 
1. Section 2(a) and "belier': effecting true equality and reconciliation 
6. As set out in the jurisprudence, the scope of the protection afforded bys. 2(a) is the right to "act 
in accordance with religious beliefs" [emphasis added].5 Generally speaking, the protection of a religious 
"act" necessarily results in the protection of the ancillary religious "belief', without the need for any 
additional tangible protection of that "belief'. This is because, for most claimants, "belief' is internal and 
does not depend on any such additional protection. 
7. For example, Orthodox Sikhs "believe" that their religion commands them to wear a kirpan.6 
Thus, in protecting a claimant's right to wear a kirpan (i.e. the "act"),7 this Court has also protected the 
Sikh claimant's "belief' that he or she is required to do so. As a further example, this Court has also 
refused to compel religious officials to perform same-sex marriages (i.e. the "act"). As a consequence of 
refusing to do so, it has also protected the officials' internally held "belief' that their religion prohibits 
them from performing this act.8 Thus, at least as far as the jurisprudence is concerned, the protection of 
the religious "act" under s. 2(a) effectively functions to protect both "act" and "belief' for most claimants. 
8. In the case of First Nation claimants whose spirituality depends on the existence of a sacred site, 
however, we are faced with a different kind of "belief': one that is not entirely internal but that is 
inextricably connected to the sanctity of the site itself. In other words, the spiritual "belief' and the land 
are one and the same. On this note, the jurisprudence has also documented the interconnectedness of First 
Nation spiritual beliefs and the land: 
... the relationship that Aboriginal peoples have with the land cannot be understated. The land is 
the very essence of their being. It is their very heart and soul. No amount of money can 
compensate for its loss. Aboriginal identity, spirituality, laws, traditions, culture, and rights are 
connected to and arise from this relationship to the land. This is a perspective that is ... often 
difficult to understand from a non-Aboriginal viewpoint.9

BOA, Tab 5. 3 
9. In light of this interconnection between First Nation spiritual belief and the land, it becomes 
apparent how pointless the Court of Appeal's protection of the Ktunaxa's ceremonial "act" was in this 
case, absent the protection of the land on which Ktunaxa's spiritual "belief' related to Grizzly Bear Spirit 
relies. By failing to protect the sacred site upon which the "belief' relies, it thus failed to accomplish the 
function of s. 2(a). 
10. Put another way, failing to protect the sacred site upon which their belief relies denied the 
Ktunaxa the ability to genuinely "believe" in accordance with the scope of s. 2(a), 10 and further made the 
Court of Appeal an "arbiter of religious dogma" (a role which this Court has historically refused to 
accept). JI To avoid being such an arbiter, it is thus submitted that, pursuant to s. 2(a), this Court must 
protect not only Ktunaxa's ceremonial "act" in respect of Grizzly Bear Spirit, but also Ktunaxa's ability 
to "believe" in Grizzly Bear Spirit via the protection of Qatmuk. 
11. Of course, the practical consequence of this is that s. 2(a) will look different for First Nation 
claimants with spiritual connections to the land (such as the Ktunaxa) than it does for other claimants. 
That is, for such First Nation claimants, s. 2(a) will protect two things (i.e. the religious "act" and the 
sanctity of the sacred site that is required for "belief') rather than one (i.e. the "act" alone), as is generally 
the case for most claimants whose "belief' is internal and the protection thereof necessarily follows from 
the protection of the "act". Yet despite this differential protection, Katzie submits that understanding 
s. 2(a) in this manner is the only way to afford First Nations the same Charter protections enjoyed by 
other Canadians and hence effect true equality in this respect. As some academics have noted, such 
"group differentiated rights" may well be necessary where a given individual or group requires different 
rights to "protect their identity by limiting their vulnerability to the decisions of the larger society", 12 and 
thus achieve equality with the majority.13 
12. Furthermore, the provision of a unique s. 2(a) right for First Nation claimants with spiritual 
connections to the land is also a necessary step on the path toward reconciliation. As this Court noted 
with respect to resolving land claims: "The governing ethos is not one of competing interests but of 
reconciliation".14 Katzie submits that this ethos of reconciliation should be no less important when

defining the scope of a First Nation's s. 2(a) right, even if this means that in effect, the protection is 
distinct from that afforded to other Canadian claimants. 
2. Protecting sacred sites will not overextend the proper scope of section 2(a) 
13. Katzie submits that protecting the sacred sites of First Nations will not lead to an influx of 
religious claimants seeking to protect land via s. 2(a) of the Charter. While ancient spiritual connections 
to land may abound in other countries and with other religions, in Canada, it is only the first inhabitants of 
this country -the First Nations -that can legitimately claim the centrality of land to their spirituality and 
belief system. First Nations have been here since time immemorial, and so too have their spiritual 
connections to the land. No other religion in Canada can objectively prove such connections. Hence, it is 
likely that no other religious claimants will successfully argue that s. 2(a) requires the protection of a 
particular piece of land, as foundation for a spiritual "belief'. 
B. The decision maker must meaningfully weigh both sets of Charter values 
14. Katzie submits that the Minister's decision does not reflect a proportional balancing of the 
Charter right and the statutory objective at issue (Issue (c)). As set out below, when a meaningful 
balancing of the relevant Charter values is carried out per the Loyola High School v Quebec (Attorney 
General) ("Loyola")15 analysis, it becomes evident that the Charter values underlying Ktunaxa's s. 2(a) 
right outweigh the Charter values underlying the material statutory objectives. 
1. The Loyola analysis requires a consideration of the Charter values underlying both 
the Charter right and statutory objectives at play 
15. As set out in Loyola, once a Charter right has been claimed, established, and infringed in the 
administrative context, the next step is for the decision maker to determine whether that right can be 
upheld in light of the statutory objectives at issue, via a proportional balancing of that right and the 
objectives. The ultimate decision -whether it favours the upholding of the right or the infringement of 
the right in the face of the statutory objective -must be one that "accord[ s] with the fundamental values 
protected by the Charter". 16 
16. The Appellant's submissions imply that in this balancing exercise, it will not be possible for a 
broadly drafted statutory objective such as the "public interest" to override Charter rights.17 In Katzie's 
view, however, this presents a possible floodgates concern, since many Canadian statutes (including for 
15 Loyola High School v Quebec (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 12 at paras 37, 39, [2015] 1 SCR 613, ABA, Tab 21 
[Loyola]. 
16 Ibid at para 37. 
17 Ktunaxa Factum at paras 94-104. 5 
example those that facilitate regulatory decisions, such as the National Energy Board Act and the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012) compel decisions in the "public interest".18 As such 
every time a Charter right was claimed in the context of a decision made under such a statute, the 
statutory objective could never prevail. 
17. Given this untenable result, Katzie submits that even in the case of a broadly drafted statutory 
objective, the proportionality exercise in Loyola demands a meaningful balancing of the Charter right at 
stake against the statutory objective.19 This, in turn, requires considering the respective values underling 
b th the right and lbe broadly drafted statutory objective in question. 
18. The need to consider values that underlie the statutory objective (in addition to those underlying 
the right) is supported by the jurisprudence dictating that the "core national values" underlying legislation 
cannot be overlooked, even in the face of a Charter right.20 Rather, the respective values that underlie 
both must be balanced. Specifically, as the Court set out in Loyola [emphasis added]:21 
This does not mean that religious differences [i.e. Charter rights and the values that underlie 
these] trump core national values. On the contrary, as this Court observed in Bruker v. Marcovitz, 
2007 SCC 54 (CanLII), [2007] 3 S.C.R. 607: 
Not all differences [i.e. claimed Charter rights] are compatible with Canada s 
fundamental values (i.e. those underlying the statutory objective] and, accordingly, not all 
barriers to tJ1eir expression are arbitra1y. Detennining when the assertion of a right based 
on difference must yield to a more pressing pubHc interest is a complex, nuanced, fact­
specific exercise that defies bright-line application. It is, at the same time, a delicate 
necessity for protecting the evolutionary integrity of both multiculturalism and public 
confidence in its importance. [para. 2] 
Or, as the Bouchard-Taylor report observed: 
A democratic, liberal State cannot be indifferent to certain core values, especially basic 
human rights, the equality of all citizens before the law, and popular sovereignty. These 
are the constituent values of our political system and they provide its foundation. 
19. Moreover, if pursuant to Loyola, the ultimate decision must accord with Charter values,22 and if 
in some instances statutory objectives will outweigh the Charter right in the balancing exercise,23 it must

be the case that Charter values (or "core national values") underlie those statutory objectives. Thus, even 
where the statutory objective in question is broadly drafted, decision makers must do their best to 
examine and balance the underlying values. 
20. In short, Katzie submits that what Loyola requires in this case is a meaningful balancing of the 
respective Charter values underling Ktunaxa's s. 2(a) right with respect to its sacred site, against those 
underling the relevant statutory objectives. 
2. Identifying and balancing the relevant values 
21. As set out in more detail below, Katzie submits distinct important values underlie both Ktunaxa's 
s. 2(a) Charter right and the relevant statutory objectives. Per Loyola, these values must be identified and 
weighed against one another. 
22. Although the identification of such values is a task for the decision maker on a case by case basis, 
it will inevitably require the decision maker to consider not only the values identified in the jurisprudence, 
but also in the national socio-political climate at the time of the decision. Given this, Katzie submits that 
a reasonable manner of identifying these values is to review both the jurisprudence, and current federal 
political mandates and parliamentary debates, as these are all real-time reflections of Canada's democratic 
v01ce. 
a. Values that may underlie the relevant statutory objectives 
23. The relevant statutory objectives at play in the present case are set out in the Ministry of Lands, 
Parks, and Housing Act,24 and the Land Acr5 in conjunction with the All-Seasons Resort Policy (as set 
out in the Respondent's factum26). Specifically, the objective of the Ministry of Lands, Parks, and 
Housing Act is to "to ensure the maintenance and improvement of a quality system of parks and the 
encouragement of the best use of Crown land for agricultural, residential, industrial, commercial and 
recreational opportunities within the province of British Columbia",27 and to "administer the Crown land" 
and "encourage outdoor recreation, establish parks and conserve the natural scenic and historic features of

British Columbia" .28 The objectives of the Land Act are to facilitate the disposal and use of Crown land 
in the public interest, to designate Crown land for recreational uses and prohibit foreign purchases of 
Crown land,29 and to dispose of Crown land where "the minister considers advisable in the public 
interest". 30 
24. As such, Katzie submits the core national values underlying these statutory objectives as they 
relate to this decisioo are: (i) economic development/job creation; (ii) enjoyment of nature; and (iii) 
property rights. 
Economic development and job creation 
25. This Court has recognized economic development as a core national value underlying a statutory 
objective. As Chief Justice Lamer stated in Delgamuukw v British Columbia [emphasis added]: "In my 
opinion, ... general economic development of the interior of British Columbia, ... [is] the [kind] of 
[objective] that ... can justify the infringement of aboriginal title."31 
26. Additionally, underscoring the current importance of economic development and job creation in 
Canada, all thirty mandate letters from Prime Minister Trudeau to his Executive Cabinet Ministers (the 
"Mandate Letters") contain instructions to make economic development and job creation a national 
priority [emphasis added]: "We made a commitment to invest in growing our economy ... to public 
investment as the best way to spLu· economic growth, job creation, and broad-based prosperity .... "32 
Enjoyment of nature 
27. The Mandate Letter to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change confers a requirement to 
ensure that more Canadians "have an opportunity to experience Canada's outdoors", and "learn more 
about our environment."33 In a similar expression of the democratic voice, the importance of outdoor 
recreation has often been relied on by Members of Parliament in debates, and when discussing the value

of parks and outdoor recreation to Canadians.34 
28. Furthermore, the jurisprudence has recognized the enjoyment of nature as a core national value, 
capable of being balanced against Charter values.35 An Ontario Superior Court judge recently observed 
that "the public from all over the world take their children to the Parks to get away from the insults and 
abuse of everyday life". 36 
Property rights 
29. Despite the fact that property rights were not ultimately granted Charter protection, both the 
legislature and judiciary have contemplated but dismissed the inclusion of such a right under the 
Charter.37 Katzie submits that this contemplation itself signals the core national importance of property 
rights. As parliamentary scholar David Johansen observes, "[p ]roperty rights have played a central role in 
the evolution of Canadian society and indeed are an essential part of British parliamentary democracy", 
and can be "traced back to the year 1215, when the Magna Carta was signed."38 
b. Values that may underlie Ktunaxa's section 2(a) right 
30. Katzie submits that the values underlying Ktunaxa's s. 2(a) Charter right include: (i) the 
intertwined values of true equality, human dignity, and a legitimately functioning democracy; and (ii) 
reconciliation. Each of these is discussed below. 
True equality, human dignity. and democracy 
31. Katzie submits that a nation can be neither secular (free) nor truly democratic if the Charter 
values of true equality and universal human dignity are not given significant weight at the balancing 
stage. 
32. This Court has recognized that in order for the Canadian democratic process to meaningfully 
include all Canadians (and thus function as a truly responsible government), the Charter value of freedom 
of religion must be given significant weight in order to allow for equal human dignity and the ensuing 
equal ability to participate in the democratic process. Speaking about the fundamental importance of

equal human dignity as between citizens 111 order to enable the legitimate operation of a free and 
democratic society, Dickson J. drew a parallel between the American First Amendment, and s. 2 of the 
Charter, noting:39 
[a]n emphasis on individual conscience and individual judgment also lies at the heart of our 
democratic political tradition. The ability of each citizen to make free and informed decisions is 
the absolute prerequisite for the legitimacy, acceptability, and efficacy of our system of self­
govemment. [Equal rights of the individual] are the sine qua non of the [free democratic] 
political tradition underlying the Charter. 
Reconciliation 
33. Katzie further submits that reconciliation with First Nations is another fundamental value that 
underlies a First Nation's s. 2(a) right in respect of a sacred site. Indeed, in aJI thirty Mandate Letters, the 
Prime Minister stressed the paramountcy of this value, noting [emphasis added]: "No relationship is 
more important to me and to Canada than the one with Indigenous Peoples. It is time for a renewed, 
nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples, based on recognition of rights, respect, co­
operation, and partnership."40 It is submitted that this need for reconciliation -which extends to the 
recognition of "rights" -is therefore is a fundamental value underlying a First Nation's s. 2(a) right. 
Thus, it too must be given significant weight at the balancing stage. 
c. The final balance: the values underlying the section 2(a) right must prevail 
34. As set out above, Loyola requires a balancing of the values underling both the Charter right and 
Statutory Objectives. Thus, the complete failure of the decision makers in this case to even identify the 
values to be weighed, much less balance them in a meaningful way, is untenable. That said, and as set out 
above, so too is the view thats. 2(a) will always prevail over broadly drafted "public interest" objectives. 
Thus, a case-by-case identification and meaningful evaluation of all underlying values is needed. 
35. Katzie has attempted to identify the relevant values above. When these values are weighed 
against one another, it is Katzie's submission those values underlying Ktunaxa's s. 2(a) right must 
prevail. Katzie submits that although property rights, the enjoyment of nature, and economic development 
and job creation are undoubtedly core values in a capitalist society which has historically emphasized 
resource use and enjoyment, these values do not legitimate Canadian free and democratic society itself. 
As such, they must be considered secondary to those which do: true equality, human dignity, and 
reconciliation.

40 See, for example, Mandate Letter from Rt Hon Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister, to Jody Wilson-Raybould, 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada [nd], online at: <Jmp://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-justice-and­
attorney-general-canada-mandate-letter>, BOA, Tab 15. 10 
36. Specifically , Katzie's submissions have contended that true participation m the democratic 
process, and thus a truly representative democracy, relies on the recognition of true equality and human 
dignity brought about by ongoing reconciliation with First Nations, both in the legislature and the courts. 
3 7. It would be difficult to definitively prove a causal link between increased First Nation voter 
turnout in the 2015 federal election 41 and recent judicial and government commitment to reconciliation, 
though the apparent correlation is hard to ignore. As recent efforts towards reconciliation with First 
Nations increase, so too does First Nation participation in the democratic process.42 
38. Similarly, the historic under-representation of First Nations in the Canadian democratic process43 
has resulted in an under-representation of the First Nation perspective in legislation, including those 
pieces of legislation at issue in this appeal and their respective statutory objectives. 
39. Katzie contends that as the judiciary, government, and society continue down the path towards 
reconciliation with First Nations, increased First Nation human dignity will lead to increased Frist Nation 
participation in Canada's democratic process, increased First Nation's influence over legislation, and 
ultimately, a decrease in the number of conflicts between core Canadian values as seen in this appeal. 
40. Katzie submits that the ultimate decision in this appeal will either increase or decrease the 
recognition of First Nation human dignity and First Nation inclusion in Canada's free and democratic 
society, and thus set the pathway for tomorrow. Katzie submits that the values underlying Ktunaxa's 
s. 2(a) Charter right outweigh those underlying the statutory objectives in this appeal.
