PART I -OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS 
A. Overview 
1. Gift Lake Metis Settlement ("Gift Lake") is one of eight land-based, selfÂ­
governing Metis communities created by Alberta's Metis Settlements Act ("MSA,,).l It is 
situated some 400 km North of Edmonton. 
2. The particular circumstances surrounding the the Metis of northern 
Alberta, as set out in the existing evidentiary record, are directly relevant to two key 
issues raised in this appeal: namely that Metis are "Indians" within the meaning of the 
phrase "Indians and lands reserved for Indians" found within s. 91(24) of the Constitution 
Act, 1867 (the "First Declaration"), and that there is clear utility to issuing a declaration 
to this effect. 
3. In this regard, it is noteworthy that Canada dealt with the Metis of 
Northern Alberta (where Gift Lake is situated) by way of a scrip commission in 1899 that 
operated in direct parallel to the treaty commission of that same year that was mandated 
by the Dominion to deal with the First Nation inhabitants of that same broad territory. 
This reality underscores the central fact that notwithstanding the clear distinctiveness of 
Metis people and culture, Metis communities were considered by Canada to have 
Aboriginal rights similar though not identical to those of First Nations, which rights 
needed to be addressed as part of the Canadian government's nation-building project. 
4. It is also noteworthy that the history of the Alberta Metis is punctuated by 
Canada's selective exercise of its 91(24) jurisdiction. The genesis of the Alberta Metis 
settlements arises almost singularly from Canada's failure to fulfil its promise to provide 
the Alberta Metis with land under the scrip system initiated and administered by Canada 
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Over the ensuing decades, and in the absence of 
clarity as to whether Metis and non-status Indians are "Indians" for the purposes of 
91 (24), the Alberta Metis have been negatively impacted in real ways. Thus, clarification 
1 R.S.A. 2000, c. M-14. 2 
as to legislative authority in regard to Metis peoples is not only practical, but essential to 
the unfinished proj ect of reconciliation with the Metis. 
5. However, and contrary to the position taken by the Appellants and certain 
other interveners, there is a lack of utility in broadly re-asserting the existence of 
fiduciary and consultative duties by the Crown -whether federal or provincial -toward 
Metis peoples. 
B. Facts relevant to this intervention 
6. The Metis' history in northern Alberta and history of dealings with 
Canada provide an important context and perspective to the issue of Metis inclusion in 
91(24). Canada operated its scrip system between 1870 and 1930 to provide Metis with 
allocations of land or money. The intent of this system was to extinguish any "Indian 
title or claim" of Metis. It was employed in Manitoba in 1870, throughout the northwest 
in the 1880s, and later on in the area of Treaty 8, in what is now northern Alberta.2 
7. In Manitoba, Canada promised to distribute 1.4 million acres "towards the 
extinguishment of the Indian Title to the lands in the Province" while assuring the 
Manitoba Metis that it would "be of a nature to meet the wishes of the half-breed 
residents" and distributed "in the most effectual and equitable manner.,,3 In MMF, this 
Court held that Canada failed to live up to that promise. Following this failure, the Metis 
were soon displaced by settlers and forced to move further west.4 
8. In 1881, Metis located at the historic Metis community of Fort Edmonton 
petitioned Canada for scrip allocations in fulfilment of Canada's promise to them.5 The 
scrip commission eventually arrived in Edmonton in 1885 and 1886 and provided scrip to 
eligible Metis. Most Metis did not take the land, but rather sold it for cash.6 
9. In 1889, the Superintendent of Mines wrote the following regarding scrip: 
2 Trial decision, , 316. 
3 Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 see 14'31,38 ("MMF'). 
4 MMF, 39,128,150. 10. 3 
I know of no single case where the original grantee obtained the land; he sells his scrip 
and locates it for the purchaser wherever the latter may desire it. In this way lands are 
acquired at a nominal rate, in some cases as low as 70 cents an acre? 
By 1895, the Metis were becoming destitute. In response to the need to 
provide the Metis with land, a Metis reserve and industrial school were established by 
Canada in the area that is now known as St. Paul, Alberta. It proved to be a failure and 
was closed.8 
11. In 1899, the Minister of the Interior wrote to the Governor in Council 
requesting a scrip commission be appointed to address claims of those Metis who were 
not otherwise eligible under the Manitoba Act, 1870. The Minister recommended that 
Metis claims be addressed concurrently with Indian treaties as part of Order in Council 
918: 
12. [ ... J 15th July, 1870, was selected as the date applicable to the Halfbreeds because it was 
the date of the transfer from the Hudson's Bay Company, But the Halfbreeds of the 
District of Athabasca and adjoining country were not affected by the transfer. Whatever 
rights they have, they have in virtue of their Indian blood; and the first interference with 
such rights will be when a surrender is effected of the territorial claims of the Indians. It 
is obvious that while differing in degree, Indian and Halfbreed rights in an unceded 
territory must be co-existent, and should properly be extinguished at the same time.9 
This scrip was to be provided under the Dominion Lands Act. The Act 
provided that the grants would issue "on such terms and conditions, as may be deemed 
expedient." However, as was the case in Manitoba, no "terms and conditions" were 
spelled out by the Act, and the scrip was issued on an ad hoc basis, facilitating predatory 
land speculation. 
13. In 1899, s. 90 of the Dominion Lands Act was amended to allow granting 
"lands in satisfaction of claims of half-breeds arising out of the extinguishment of Indian 
title." 1 0 Despite serious concerns raised in Parliament in relation to the risk of land

speculators taking advantage of Metis, no effective protections were implemented.11 
Between 1899 and 1921, Canada abandoned any idea of protecting Metis from 
speCUlation, and began issuing cash compensation to Metis in parallel with treaty 
payments to members of First Nations and Metis who had taken treaty. 12 
14. Ultimately, the scrip system failed the Alberta Metis as it did the Manitoba 
Metis, and they were left destitute. As the trial judge observed, in 1930 a dialogue 
occurred between Alberta and Canada regarding responsibility for "indigent halfÂ­
breeds.,,13 In 1934, Alberta appointed a Royal Commission to investigate Metis problems, 
and subsequently accepted his recommendations. This led to the creation of 12 Metis 
"colonies" under the Metis Population Betterment Act in 1938, which evolved into the 
current MSA after a process of negotiation in the 1980s.14 
15. Today, the Metis settlement lands are held and self-governed by Metis 
people. Protections on the lands are now entrenched in Alberta's constitution, in 
contemplation that they may one day be included in the constitution of Canada. 15 This 
Court has described the MSA as "the result of a negotiation process between the Metis of 
Alberta and the Province and the outcome of an ongoing struggle for self-preservation.,,16 
PART II -POSITION ON QUESTIONS IN ISSUE 
16. Gift Lal(e makes the following submissions: 
(a) The history of the Metis of northern Alberta from whom the members of 
Gift Lake are descended supports the conclusion that the Metis are 
included in 91(24); 
(b) There is utility and indeed necessity in determining whether Parliament 
has legislative jurisdiction over Metis in order to advance the unfinished 
project of reconciliation with Metis;

(c) It is not necessary to attempt to exhaustively define 'who' the Metis are to 
decide that they are included in 91(24); and 
(d) It is not necessary to consider the issues raised by the Second and Third 
Declarations in relation to Crown consultative or fiduciary duties, and this 
Court should not do so in a factual vacuum. 
PART III-STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT 
B. The lower Courts' conclusions on 91(24) were correct and factually 
supported 
17. The trial judge's key legal conclusion was premised on the purpose of 
91(24), holding that it encompassed at least three objectives: (i) the intent to control all 
people of aboriginal heritage, (ii) to honour Crown obligations inherited from Britain to 
extinguish aboriginal interests in land, and (iii) to "civilize and assimilate" Aboriginal 
peoples.I7 
18. Canada's creation of the scrip system was a key consideration in the trial 
judge's conclusion in that regard. He acknowledged that even with Metis, who were of 
varying degrees of mixed Aboriginal ancestry, "the federal government accepted the 
existence of a title or interest on the part of Indians that had to be addressed in some 
way.,,18 
19. Indeed, Canada chose to exercise the 91(24) power within the scrip system 
in attempting to extinguish Metis "Indian title." The creation of a system that purported 
to address the "Indian title" held by the Metis is persuasive evidence that the government 
counted the Metis as being part of the "people sharing a native hereditary base" that the 
91 (24) power was designed to address in order to facilitate the obj ects of confederation. 19 
20. The scrip process commenced shortly after Confederation. It was 
inextricably linked to the federal government's efforts to treat with the prior Aboriginal 
occupants of the land, in order to quiet title, with a view to settling, developing and 
uniting the new nation by transcontinental railway. The relevant statutes and instruments 
17 Trial decision, ~ 352-354,566. 
18 Trial decision, ~ 411. Laws to control and "civilize and assimilate" Metis were also enacted: ~ 443-452 6 
consistently reference the purpose of scrip as being "in extinguishment of Indian title.,,2o 
In northern Alberta, the scrip process was intimately connected to the negotiation of 
Treaty 8, and operated in parallel to the Treaty 8 treaty commission, in clear exercise of 
the federal 91(24) power.21 
21. While the scrip process began prior to the establishment of Alberta as a 
province in 1905, it did so as part of the effort to quiet Aboriginal title and rights, and 
continued well after the creation of the province. There was no transfer of responsibility 
from the federal government to the province for the issuance of scrip. 
22. In Gift Lake's submission, the trial judge was correct in holding that the 
inclusion of the Metis in 91(24) accords with its historical purpose.22 The primary 
purpose of 91(24) is today as it was in 1867: a responsibility to deal honourably with 
Aboriginal peoples before settlement may occur, in a manner consonant with the Royal 
Proclamation, 1867 and the the honour of the Crown.23 In 1867, the dominant object of 
so doing was to build a nation; today, it is to achieve reconciliation within that nation. 
23. Contrary to Canada's submission,24 s. 91 (24)'s historic roots in the Royal 
Proclamation, 1763 does not speak to that power being one of paternalism or to a need to 
deal with Aboriginal people as "wards." As this Court has found, the Royal 
Proclamation was a recognition of Aboriginal "strength, not weakness and need of 
protection". 25 
B. The First Declaration's practical utility

Carswell, 2007 at 28-2: "[t]he Royal Proclamation of 1763 had established that treaty-making with the 
Indians was the sole responsibility of the (imperial) Crown in right of the United Kingdom. After 
confederation, the federal govermnent was the natural successor to that responsibility."

25 MMF~66. 7 
24. In Gift Lake's respectful submission, it does not lie in Canada's mouth to 
argue that the First Declaration lacks "practical utilty". Canada's longstanding refusal to 
acknowledge underlying legislative authority in relation to Metis people is at the heart of 
prolonged federal indifference toward Metis. As stated by this Court in Cunningham: : 
25. [ ... ] The MSA, as discussed earlier, is the result of a negotiation process between the 
Metis of Alberta and the Province and the outcome of an ongoing struggle for selfÂ­
preservation. The Metis considered themselves as one of three Aboriginal groups in 
Canada, but this was not recognized until the Constitution Act, 1982. Unlike Indians, 
however, they enjoyed no land base from which to strengthen their identity and culture or 
govern themselves. Nor did they enjoy the protection of an equivalent to the Indian Act. 
Their aboriginality, in a word, was not legally acknowledged or protected. Viewed in this 
perspective, the ameliorative program embodied in the MSA emerges as an attempt to 
provide to Alberta's Metis settlements similar protections to those which various Indian 
bands have enjoyed since early times.26 [emphasis added] 
This issue has manifested itself as a serious issue of disparity in relation to 
programs, services, and other benefits available to Alberta Metis. In Cunningham, the 
litigants were Metis persons who were eligible to register as status Indians, and had of 
necessity done so to obtain federal medical benefits available to status Indians and Inuit 
but not Metis, and thereby terminated their Metis Settlement memberships.27 
26. In this regard, this Court commented that preserving an impetus for Metis 
persons to pursue such important issues of parity with the federal government was 
supportive ofthe MSA's ameliorative objects, and drawing bright lines as between status 
Indians and Metis settlement members under its provisions?8 
27. Second, the Court of Appeal held that the First Declaration had utility in 
assisting "in extra-judicial negotiations with the Crown in pursuit of the overarching 
constitutional goal of reconciliation reflected in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 
1982,,29 and in clarifying the jurisdictional lines where claims may be at issue, such as 
treaties or land claims agreements relating to unextinguished Metis Aboriginal rights.3o 
26 Cunningham ~ 66. 
27 Cunningham ~ 25. 
28 Cunningham ~ 78. 
29 Appeal decision ~ 68. 
30 Appeal decision ~ 72. 8 
28. Indeed, since the adoption of s. 35, this Court has laid an important 
foundation, and constructed large portions of the architecture, of Aboriginal rights in 
relation to First Nation peoples. Most recently, it confirmed the landmark Aboriginal title 
claim of the Tsilhqot'in/1 and clarified provincial-federal responsibilities under First 
Nation treaties.32 
29. The same project in relation to Metis is however in its infancy. In R. v. 
Powley, this Court adjusted the Van der Peet test to recognize the Metis' inclusion as one 
of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, and in particular "the important differences between 
Indian and Metis claims" and "the unique post-contact emergence of Metis communities, 
and the post-contact foundation of their aboriginal rights.,,33 More recent decisions by 
this Court in the MMF and Cunningham cases have further developed this jurisprudence. 
While its is clear that the provincial Crowns bear certain responsibilities toward Metis 
Gust as they do toward First Nations), the limits of that provincial jurisdiction, and the 
scope of federal authority, if any, require delineation in order to foster the ongoing 
project of reconciliation. 
30. In this regard, reconciliation may include the obligation to exercise the 
91(24) power honourably, in appropriate circumstances.34 This Court has recently 
emphasized that both levels of government are responsible for keeping treaty promises.35 
While this case is not about treaty promises per se, it is clear that matters have arisen of 
unique and central concern to Metis, and jurisdictional uncertainty or unwillingness to act 
have frustrated the resolution of these issues.36

34 Resort may be had to the unwritten principles in triggering a requirement to act in relation to Metis 
interests or concemts. This Court has previously held that the unwritten principles may give rise to "very 
abstract and general obligations, or they may be more specific and precise in nature.": Secession Reference

31. Gift Lake submits that this case is not the proper vehicle for determining 
who is and who is not Metis; rather, that determination must be made in cases that engage 
that issue expressly, and based on a detailed factual record directed to that issue. 
32. The issue in this case is which order of government has legislative 
authority over Metis, however defined. This Court has held that in constititutional cases 
it is improper to attempt to answer unnecessary questions, or precisely define a head of 
power.37 
33. Although Metis were first textually acknowledged in s. 35(2), so too were 
Inuit, who are included as 'Indians' in 91(24).38 Accordingly, the distinctiveness of Metis 
vis-a-vis Indians or Inuit is not a bar to inclusion as 'Indians' in 91(24). Nor does it give 
rise to a need to define who is or is not Metis. Such definitional issues may arise in 
subsequent cases, informed though not constrained by the limited guidance provided by 
this Court in Powley?9 
D. It is not necessary for this Court to address the issues related to the Second 
and Third Declarations in relation to Crown consultative or fiduciary duties 
34. In MMF and Grassy Narrows, this Court confirmed that the Crown's 
relationship with the Metis "viewed generally, is fiduciary in nature" but its content may 
vary with the circumstances40 and that either level of Crown contemplating conduct that 
may affect Aboriginal rights may give rise to a duty of consultation.41 
35. Accordingly, the requested Second and Third declarations would merely 
repeat the existing state of the law. Fiduciary and consultative duties toward Metis 
peoples are that of the Crown. Depending on the circumstances, such duties as toward 
Metis may fall to either level of Crown.42 A finding of federal jurisdiction over Metis

peoples should not be taken to detract from the existence and exercise, in appropriate 
circumstances, of a provincial fiduciary or consultative duty toward Metis. 
E. Conclusion 
36. The lower Courts' decision to issue the First Declaration is well-supported 
in fact and law, and had practical utility. This is not the proper case to define 'Metis'. 
37. The honour of the Crown and its consultative and fiduciary duties apply 
broadly to the Metis as one of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, and both the content and 
the bearer of those duties may vary with different factual circumstances. The requested 
Second and Third Declarations would merely repeat the existing state of the law.

39. Gift Lake submits that this case should be decided in line with the above 
principles, and requests permission to address the Court orally at the hearing of this 
appeal.
