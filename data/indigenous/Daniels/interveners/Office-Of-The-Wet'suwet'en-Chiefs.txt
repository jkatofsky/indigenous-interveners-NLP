PART I -STATEMENT OF FACTS 
1. The Intervener, the Office of the Wet'suwet'en Hereditary Chiefs ("OW") supports the 
Appellants herein and submits that it is essential that the Courts recognize aboriginal title for 
there to be true reconciliation of Crown and aboriginal interests. 
2. The OW represents the Wet'suwet'en Chiefs! in treaty negotiations and in addressing 
major issues within Wet'suwet'en Territory of common interest to the Wet'suwet'en people. The 
Wet'suwet'en agreed to enter treaty negotiations with the Crown in 1977. When negotiations 
failed, they and the Gitksan instituted the Delgamuukw legal proceedings in October 1984.2 
3. The Delgamuukw trial began in May 1987 and was completed on June 30, 1990, after 
387 trial days. The March 1991 judgment held that aboriginal title in British Columbia had been 
extinguished by 1860s colonial laws. Alternatively, the Court held that if the aboriginal rights 
had not been extinguished, they continued to exist in an area which he described on "Map 5" 
which incorporated a large portion of Wet' suwet' en territory. 3 
4. The Wet'suwet'en and Gitksan appealed. The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed 
the appeal in June 1993, declaring that the Wet'suwet'en and Gitksan had unextinguished, non­
exclusive aboriginal rights, other than ownership or property rights, in the Map 5 area.4 After 
this decision, OW again entered treaty negotiations under the new BC Treaty Process. These 
negotiations were unsuccessful notwithstanding the Court of Appeal's decision.5 As a result, the 
OW appealed the Court of Appeal Delgamuukw decision to this Court. 
5. In Delgamuukw, this Court overturned the trial judge's factual findings because he had 
given no independent weight to the oral histories which had been used to prove occupation and 
use of the territory to which aboriginal title was claimed and concluded that, had the trial judge 
given proper weight to oral history, his conclusions on the requisite degree of occupation to 
prove "ownership" might have been very different.6 
L The Wet'suwet'en Chiefs are Plaintiffs in Delgamuukw v. The Queen, [1997] 3 SCR 1010, [("Delgamuukw 
(SCC)"].

5 Sam (BCSC), para. 25 
6 Delgamuukw (SCC), para. 107 2 
6. This Court also found that, because the pleadings were not amended to reflect the 
amalgamation of the individual house claims into a Gitksan and a Wet'suwet'en claim, a new 
trial was required.7 The Court urged the parties to negotiate a resolution rather than have a new 
trial and affirmed the role of the courts in aiding reconciliation.8 
7. In its consideration of the trial judge's treatment ofthe evidence, this Court discussed the 
adaawk and kungax, the sacred 'official' oral histories of the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en, 
respectively, which were offered as proof of the existence of a system of land tenure laws.9 This 
Court also stated that affidavits containing evidence of the territorial holdings of each of the 
Gitksan and Wet' suwet' en houses were relevant to the existence and nature of their land tenure 
systems and therefore material to the proof of aboriginal title. 10 
8. The existence of a Wet'suwet'en land tenure system and its connection to Wet'suwet'en 
governance and social structure was noted more recently by the BC Supreme Court: 
To fully appreciate the background facts to these applications and to ultimately 
assess factors of irreparable harm and balance of convenience, it is important to 
understand the relationship of the Wet'suwet'en to the land, and, in particular, to 
the lands in question here, known as the Redtop. It is the relationship to particular 
lands that defines the social structure of Wet'suwet'en society, that places the land 
as the foundation of cultural identity, and that determines the structure of 
governance. 
The Wet'suwet'en occupation and use of land is organized by the clan and house 
system upon which the law and essential social structure is ultimately based. The 
five Wet'suwet'en clans are each composed of several houses, 13 in all. A house is 
a matrilineage of people related through their mothers. Each house has one or 
more territories which together comprise the Wet'suwet'en territory. Each house 
has a chief and a sub-chief who collectively make up the head chiefs of the 
Wet'suwet'en. Each Wet'suwet'en chief has rights and responsibilities specific to 
the particular territory over which that chief is given a duty to protect. The rights 
and responsibilities are confirmed, coordinated, and directed to the common good, 
in other words, governed, through the feast. 
.. .Importantly, the feast confirms the relationship between each house and its 
territory and confirms the boundaries of each territory (Delgamuukw v. British 
Columbia 1993 CanLII 4516 (BC CA), (1993), 104 D.L.R.(4th) 470 at 608

law is both enacted and upheld .... 11 
9. After this Court's decision in Delgamuukw, OW engaged in treaty negotiations a third 
time, consistent with this Court's urging that they endeavour to negotiate a resolution.12 
However little changed in the Crown's position in regard to the Wet'suwet'en people, their land 
and resourcesl3 and in 16 years the OW and the Crown have failed to negotiate a treaty. 
10. In 2001, an Agreement was signed by the Wet'suwet'en Chief, Kelah, with the Ministry 
of Forests of BC, to protect a small portion of her traditional territory from logging. This 
Agreement became the subject of litigation when British Columbia subsequently authorized a 
third party to log the area. 14 
11. Since 1997, British Columbia has continued to allocate lands and resources under claim 
by the Wet' suwet' en to third parties. As a result, and due to the unsustainable cost of 
negotiations, the Wet'suwet'en again withdrew from the treaty process in 2007.15 
12. In 2009, the Wet'suwet'en filed an Amicus Curiae brief in support of the Petitioner the 
Hul'qumi'num Treaty Group before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
("IACHR,,).16 The Amicus Curiae brief summarized the history of the Wet'suwet'en inability to 
obtain legal protection of their aboriginal rights. 17

PART III -LEGAL ARGUMENT 
A. Proof of Aboriginal Title 
15. In Delgamuukw, this Court rejected the trial judge's analysis of the evidence -in 
particular, the oral history and anthropological evidence presented by the Wet'suwet'en and 
Gitksan. Lamer C.J. speaking for himself, Cory, McLachlin and Major n. reviewed the findings 
of the trial judge: 
There were several specific claims of the plaintiffs as to their uses of the land 
before the assertion of sovereignty. [The trial judge] concluded that the 
appellants' ancestors lived within the territory, but predominantly at the 
village sites. He accepted, at p. 372, that they harvested the resources of the 
lands, but that there was only evidence of "commonsense subsistence practices ... 
entirely compatible with bare occupation for the purposes of subsistence". He was 
not persuaded that there was any system of governance or uniform custom 
relating to land outside the villages. He refused to accept that the spiritual 
beliefs exercised within the territory were necessarily common to all the people 
or that they were universal practices. He was not persuaded that the present 
institutions of the plaintiffs' society were recognized by their ancestors. 
Rather, he found, at p. 373, that "they more likely acted as they did because of 
survival instincts" .... Although McEachern C.J. recognized the social importance 
of the feast system and the fact that it evolved from earlier practices, he did not 
accept its role in the management and allocation of lands, particularly after the 
fur trade .... 18 [emphasis added] 
16. Lamer C.J. then held: 
The trial judge's treatment of the various kinds of oral histories did not satisfy the 
principles I laid down in Van der Peet. These errors are particularly worrisome 
because oral histories were of critical importance to the appellants' case. They 
used those histories in an attempt to establish their occupation and use of the 
disputed territory, an essential requirement for aboriginal title. The trial 
judge, after refusing to admit, or giving no independent weight to these oral 
histories, reached the conclusion that the appellants had not demonstrated the 
requisite degree of occupation for "ownership". Had the trial judge assessed the 
oral histories correctly, his conclusions on these issues of fact might have 
been very different.19 [emphasis added] 
18 Delgamuukw (SCC), para. 18 
19 Delgamuukw (SCC), para. 107 5 
17. Had the oral histories been given appropriate weight, and had they shown the type of 
indicia referred to in paragraph 18 of Delgamuukw, the requisite degree of occupation and use to 
show "ownership" could have been proven. Clearly, Lamer C.l. recognized that "occupation" of 
land is a concept not limited to intensive presence at particular sites -it can be a combination of, 
inter alia, use of the resources, recognition and maintenance of borders, exercise of spiritual 
beliefs, a system of management and allocation of those lands. 
18. The oral histories to which Lamer C.J. referred are a central element of the 'aboriginal 
perspective' which this Court has repeatedly emphasized is an essential part of the assessment of 
the evidence of aboriginal title. Lamer C.l. held, and this Court reaffirmed in Marshall that 
equal weight was to be placed on the 'aboriginal perspective' and the common law perspective.2o 
19. The similarity between the decision of the trial judge in Delgamuukw, and the judgment 
of the BC Court of Appeal in this case are striking. Contrary to the directions of this Court, both 
decisions gave primacy to Euro-Canadian patterns of occupation (village sites, enclosed fields) 
over aboriginal patterns of occupation (in this case, semi-nomadic village sites, berry and root 
crop management areas and regular use of tracts of land for hunting, fishing, trapping, other 
resource use, spiritual practices). The aboriginal perspective is given less weight than the 
I . 21 common aw perspectIve. 
20. The BC Court of Appeal's emphasis on the pnmacy of Euro-Canadian patterns of 
occupation, including physical occupation, makes irrelevant both the BC Supreme Court's 
comments regarding the connectedness of the Wet' suwet' en land tenure system with 
Wet'suwet'en social and governance structure, and this Court's own comments on the 
Wet' suwet' en land tenure system's relevance to proof of aboriginal title.22 
21. Just as the trial judge in Delgamuukw restricted the possibility of aboriginal title to 
village sites, and was overturned by this Court, the BC Court of Appeal in this case imposed the 
same limitations by wrongly describing the criteria required to prove occupation as being where 
"exclusive occupation of the land is critical to the traditional culture and identity of an

Aboriginal group.',23 
22. The Court of Appeal misdirected itself by interpreting Lamer C.J. as having said that a 
piece of land had to be of central significance to the distinctive culture of the group claiming 
title, and that this is a "crucial" part of the test for aboriginal title?4 
Although this remains a crucial part of the test for aboriginal rights, given the 
occupancy requirement in the test for aboriginal title, I cannot imagine a 
situation where this requirement would actually serve to limit or preclude a 
title claim. The requirement exists for rights short of title because it is necessary 
to distinguish between those practices which were central to the culture of 
claimants and those which were more incidental. However, in the case of title, it 
would seem clear that any land that was occupied pre-sovereignty, and which the 
parties have maintained a substantial connection with since then, is sufficiently 
important to be of central significance to the culture of the claimants. As a result, 
I do not think it is necessary to include explicitly this element as part of the 
test for aboriginal title.25 [emphasis added] 
23. Lamer C.l.'s reasons in Delgamuukw were the basis for this Court's decision in 
Marshall. 26 In her discussion of Van der Peer7, NikaP8, Adami9 and C6te30, McLachlin C.J. 
pointed out that, based on the facts in those cases3!, the use of certain lands for hunting or 
fishing purposes gave rise to aboriginal rights to carry out those activities, but not to aboriginal 
title. 32 
24. Aboriginal title was not at issue in those cases, which were criminal prosecutions, and no 
evidence was adduced to support aboriginal title claims. In his concurring judgment in Marshall, 
also a criminal prosecution, LeBel 1. commented that" ... the legal issues to be determined in the 
context of aboriginal rights claims are much larger than the criminal charge itself and the 
criminal process is inadequate and inappropriate for dealing with such claims.,,33

the traditional underpinning of title at common law, summarized the requirements for proving 
aboriginal title this way: 
In summary, exclusive possession in the sense of intention and capacity to 
control is required to establish aboriginal title. Typically, this is established by 
showing regular occupancy or use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or 
exploiting resources: Delgamuukw, at para. 149. Less intensive uses may give rise 
to different rights. The requirement of physical occupation must be generously 
interpreted taking into account both the aboriginal perspective and the perspective 
of the common law: Delgamuukw, at para. 156. These principles apply to nomadic 
and semi-nomadic aboriginal groups; the right in each case depends on what the 
evidence establishes.34 
26. The essential element to prove aboriginal title is "exclusive possession in the sense of 
intention and capacity to control" the land. It may be shown in different ways but, as it can be 
difficult to show evidence of specific acts of exclusion from pre-contact times,35 aboriginal title 
can be shown through regular use of the land for purposes such as the exploitation ofresources.36 
27. In all cases, the right depends on the evidence which must be evaluated from the 
aboriginal perspective.37 The significance of the practice or event to the aboriginal people who 
seek to establish the right must be respected.38 Failing to give due weight and respect to the 
aboriginal perspective and legal systems affected is the type oflegal error that Finch C.J.B.C. (as 
he then was) warned against in "The Duty to Learn: Taking Account of Indigenous Legal Orders 
in Practice ))39, citing McLachlin 1. 's (as she then was) reasons in Van der Peet40 and Lamer 
C.l.'s reasons in Delgamuukw 41 in his warning. 
28. The BC Court of Appeal erred, as did the trial judge in Delgamuukw, by not viewing the 
evidence from the aboriginal perspective, relying instead on Euro-Canadian notions of village 
sites and enclosed fields as the yardstick against which aboriginal title is to be measured.42

42 Although this was understandable in the Delgamuukw trial judgment in which the evidentiary test for proof of 
aboriginal title had not yet been articulated by this Court, it is certainly a recognizable legal error in the case of the 
judgment under appeal as that test has been articulated and restated by this Court in Delgamuukw and Marshall. 8 
B. Reconciliation 
29. The Court below justified its narrow vision of aboriginal title by what it understood as the 
goal of reconciliation: 
.. ... There is a need to search out a practical compromise that can protect 
Aboriginal traditions without unnecessarily interfering with Crown sovereignty 
and with the well-being of all Canadians .... 43 
30. Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 is the starting point for reconciliation. That 
section does not protect "traditions" -it protects "rights". It imports "some restraint on the 
exercise of sovereign power,,44 and "gives a measure of control over government conduct and a 
strong check on legislative power,,45 The vision of reconciliation enunciated by the Court of 
Appeal minimizes both the constitutional protection of aboriginal rights and title envisioned by 
the framers of the Constitution46 and the means of reconciliation which flows from it. 
31. OW has been involved at substantial cost to the Wet'suwet'en in both litigation and treaty 
negotiations for over 35 years.47 To date, notwithstanding their efforts and reliance on Canadian 
law including the Constitution Act, 1982, the Wet' suwet' en have no recognized legal protection 
of their rights, which are no better protected today than they were on November 7, 1977, the day 
Canada accepted the Wet'suwet'en Declaration of aboriginal title for negotiation. 
32. This Court, in Delgamuukw, confirmed the role of the courts in aiding in reconciliation. 
However, this Court's direction has led to no reconciliation for the Wet'suwet'en. Not a single 
Canadian court has made a declaration of aboriginal title despite decades of litigation. No 
progress has been made in the protection of the Intervener's lands and resources.48 
33. The Wet'suwet'en have been forced to return to court to protect their aboriginal title and 
rights of access to resources and to exercise their aboriginal rights on one of the few remaining

untouched portions of their territory, an area within the Map 5 boundaries49 and one which they 
thought was additionally protected by an agreement signed with British Columbia. 50 
34. This Court in particular has underlined the importance of judicial decisions in achieving 
reconciliation. As this Court noted in 1991, the James Bay development by Hydro-Quebec was 
initiated without regard to the rights of the aboriginal peoples who lived in the territory: 
It took a number of judicial decisions and notably the Calder case in this Court 
(1973) to prompt a reassessment of the position being taken by government.51 
35. The impact of the Calder decision was almost immediate. The Federal Crown agreed to 
negotiate aboriginal title where there were no treaties, in BC, Quebec and the Territories. 52 
36. At the same time, the James Bay Cree and Inuit instituted legal proceedings in the 
Quebec Superior Court, including applying for an interlocutory injunction to stop the building of 
the hydro-electric project. Judgment granting the injunction was rendered on November 15, 
1973.53 The Government of Quebec quickly agreed to negotiate the Cree and Inuit claims, and 
by November 15, 1974 an Agreement in Principle ("AlP") was signed by Canada, Quebec, the 
Cree and the Inuit. Six days later the Quebec Court of Appeal granted Hydro-Quebec's appeal, 
overturning the judgment of the Quebec Superior Court. 54 However, with an AlP in place, 
negotiations continued and the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (the "JBNQA"), 
Canada's first comprehensive land claims agreement, was signed on November 11, 1975. 
37. While the JBNQA is one of the most detailed comprehensive land claims agreements 
ever signed, it was negotiated in two years - a stark contrast to the decades of negotiation the 
Wet'suwet'en and most other Aboriginal Nations in British Columbia have faced with no 
resulting treaty or legal protection. 
38. Analogous to the impact of Calder and the Quebec Superior Court's injunction to 
motivate true negotiations towards the JBNQA in 1973, after three years of trial, but before 
judgment was rendered in Delgamuukw, British Columbia agreed for the first time since 1860 to 
49 Map 5 was the area found by BCCA to include Wet'suwet'en aboriginal rights. Delgamuukw (BCCA), paras. 263,

negotiate aboriginal title claims and created the BC Claims Task Force whose recommendations 
would eventually set the foundation for the BC Treaty Commission. 
39. OW submits that, until aboriginal title moves from the realm of legal theory to legal 
reality, and governments are required to restitute or compensate aboriginal peoples with regard to 
ancestral lands, there will continue to be no effective remedy for the protection of their rights and 
title. The OW is mindful of this Court's necessary involvement in the route to reconciliation. 
While the OW has followed this Court's direction and sought reconciliation through good faith 
negotiations, the failure of those negotiations and continued 'business as usual' Crown conduct 
regarding Wet' suwet' en territory exemplifies the need for the Court to fulfill its role as 
contemplated in Delgamuukw and issue a declaration of the Appellants' aboriginal title which 
will reinforce the commitment of the Crown to engage in true reconciliation of Crown-aboriginal 
interests. 
PART IV -COSTS 
40. The OW does not seek costs, and asks that there be no Order of costs made against this 
Intervener other than additional disbursements occasioned to the Appellants or Respondents by 
this Intervention as directed on the Leave Application. 
PART V -ORDER SOUGHT 
41. These Interveners seek leave to make oral argument not exceeding ten minutes. 
42. These Interveners submit that the BC Court of Appeal's decision should be set aside, and 
that there should be an Order that the Tsilhqot'in have Aboriginal Title over the Proven Title 
Area.
