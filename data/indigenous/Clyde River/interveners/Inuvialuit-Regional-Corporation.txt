 PART I – OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS  
1. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) is the authority representing the rights and 
interests of more than 4500 Inuvialuit pursuant to the Inuvialuit Final Agreement  (IFA),1 which 
is a modern land claims agreement protected by section 35 of the Constitu tion Act , 1982. 
2. Protecting the  Inuvialuit’s important relationship with their Arctic marine environment  is 
a central focus of  the IFA.  The ice and waters of the Beaufort Sea and Arctic Ocean comprise 
over a third of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) s urface area. The IFA establishes and 
protects the ISR in law for present and future generations of Inuvialuit.  
3. Since the 1970s, there has been significant development of renewable and non- renewable 
resources in the ISR. The Beaufort Sea is home to both important marine wildlife populations 
with respect to which Inuvialuit have harvesting rights2 and to numerous Crown -issued oil and 
gas rights .3  
4. IRC has gained  extensive experience in the process, communication, trust and 
understanding that are necessary between modern treaty rights holders, Crown representatives, 
industry proponents and regulators to ensure both the integrity of express treaty rights and the 
maintenance of effective and mutually respectful relationships. Through negotiating  cooperation 
and benefits agreements and participati ng in negotiations for the management of oil and gas 
resources in the Beaufort Sea,4 IRC works to ensure  that the rights, interests and title expressed 
in the IFA are not eroded over time  and that the basic goals of the IFA  are pursued reasonably 
and responsibly by proponents, Crown representative s, Inuvialuit and other actors.  
5. This appeal addresses  the scope of the  Crown ’s obligations when it  undertakes decisi ons 
about development activities that may negatively impact the modern treaty rights  of Aboriginal 
people s, like the Inuit of Clyde River and Inuvialuit of the Western Arctic, who live on 
settlement lands and in marine areas of their settlement region.  
6. IRC submits where deep consultation is required, the international legal principle of free, 
prior and informed consent (“FPIC”) as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights

 of Indigenous Peoples5 (“the Declaration”) offers an incremental, logical and necessary 
clarification of the scope and content of deep consultation in Canada in the context of a modern 
treaty. It provides an appropriate standard upon which to complete and assess the work requir ed 
to satisfy a duty of deep consultation, to achieve the purposes of a modern treaty , and to promote 
reconciliation.  
PART II – QUESTION  IN ISSUE  
7. The issue in this appeal is the  scope of the duty to consult and accommodate where there 
is a proven treaty right and deep consultation is required. 
PART III – STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT 
A. Clarifying scope of deep consultation using FPIC is a logical and necessary next step  
8. In Haida Nation v. British Columbia, this Court explained that deep consultation is 
required “where a strong prima facie  case for the claim is established, the right and the potential 
infringement is of high significance to the Aboriginal peoples and the risk of non- compe nsable 
damage is high”.6  
9. Beyond identifying situation s that would trigger a duty of deep consultation, Canada’s 
courts have yet to issue detailed guidanc e on the content  of the d uty of deep consultation.7 IRC 
submits that this case provides an opportunity to explain what deep consultation means. 
10. A principal draw  of a land claims settlement is  that, after years of negotiation, rights 
holders get certainty that the rights defined and the objectives identifie d in their land claims 
agreement will be diligently protected and pursued. After ratification and the ensuing 
celebration, though, time does pass. The rights and interests that were so intimately understood 
when the agreement was signed become  simply  a file  within government bureaus  and corporate 
headquarters .  
11. Clarifying the scope of deep consultation – defining its frame  in a way that reinforces 
Inuit -to-Crown or Nation -to-Nation relationship s based on true mutual understanding – will 
provide an ass urance in law that treaty rights will be afforded adequate process and protection 
when new interest s are presented , engender  certainty among rights holders , and encourage the 
continued settlement of modern treaties.

 12. FPIC offers a frame for deep consultati on that  aligns with  and builds on the existing  
Canadian jurisprudence  on the duty to consult . Article 19 of the D eclaration requires States to ,  
[C]onsult  and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned 
through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and 
informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.
 8  
 
13. Article 32(2) further explains that States will,  
[C]onsult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned 
through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free prior and informed consent prior to the a pproval of any project affecting their lands or 
territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources.
9  
 
B. This Court can avail itself of FPIC as a useful framew ork for deep consultation  
14. The UN General Assembly adopted the Declaration on September 13, 2007 with 143 
countries voting in favour.10 Canada, along with Australia, New Zealand and the United States , 
initially voted against the Declaration.11 In 2010, Canada issued a statement of qualified support 
for the Declaration.12 In 2016, Canada announced that it is a “full supporter of the Declaration 
without qualification” and that “by adopting and implementing the declaration, we are breathing 
life in to Section 35.”13 As the Declaration as a whole can help vivify Aboriginal rights in 
Canada, so too can FPIC help animate deep consultation . 
15. The Declaration, including the provisions relating to FPIC , was developed through the 
dedicated work of Aboriginal and state leaders, legal practitioners and scholars, and civil society 
representatives over more than 20 years.14 The Declaration embodies international human rights 
principles and laws including those found in International Covenant on Civil and Political

 Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  
(ICESCR) – both binding documents at international law.15 
16. The principle of free, prior and informed consent serves  to place a balance of power – in 
the form of influence on process, information, time, and meaningful participation – in the hands 
of the people and communities who will  have to endure the consequences of  the proposed 
activity. The Special R apporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Special Rapporteur) has 
explained that together, the “principles of consultation and consent function as instrumental to 
rights of partic ipation and self -determination, and as safeguards for all those rights of indigenous 
peoples that may be affected by external actors […]”16. 
17. IRC submits that it is not necessary for this Court to make a determination on the  legal 
status  of the Declaration in  order to avail itself of the principle of free, prior and informed 
consent as a useful framework for the clarification of the duty of deep consultation in a way that aligns with domestic and international laws, values and principles.  
18. This Court frequentl y looks to international human rights law to assist in the 
interpretation of Canadian  constitutional  law.17 In Reference Re Public Service Employee 
Relations Act (Alta.) , Chief Justice Dickson explained: “ The various sources of international 
human rights law – declarations, covenants, conventions, judicial and quasi -judicial decisions of 
international tribunals, customary norms – must, […] be relevant and persuasive sources for 
interpretation of the Charter ’s provisions.”18 And further, “as the Canadian judiciary approaches 
the often general and open textured language of the Charter , the more detailed and textured 
provisions of the treaties may aid in supplying content to such imprecise concepts.”19 Dickson 
C.J.’s approach proved to be a guide in Saskatchewan Federation of Labour, where this Court

 relied on the “ emerging international consensus ” around the right to strike in international law to 
assist in interpreting the scope of s. 2(d) of the Charter .20  
19. IRC submits that, in line with the analysis above , the Declaration  is relevant to the 
interpretation of the scope and content of constitutional principles relating to Aboriginal peoples , 
including the duty to consult as a means for upholding Aboriginal rights in Canada.  
C. FPIC aligns with Canadian law  and provides certainty to negotiated settlements  
20. The principle of free, prior and informed consent provides a process  that is designed to  
secure reconciliation of the substantive and procedural rights of Aboriginal peoples with the 
interests of governments and third parties.21 FPIC is consistent with the existing body of case law 
on the duty to consult and accommodate and the general canon o f administrative law .  
Additionally, it  provide s additional tools to help realize the goal of reconciliation articulated in 
the jurisprudence on s. 35.22 Free, prior and informed consent is designed to build dialogue  
through which both States and indigenous peoples work in good faith toward consensus.23  
21. IRC submits that the process require d to achieve free, prior and informed consent in 
situations of deep consultation includes six key elements. In discharging the duty to cons ult, 
these elements combine to reinforce “the procedural safeguards of natural justice mandated by 
administrative law” .24 
22. FPIC is consistent with this Court’s statements in Taku River  that a n exhaustive  checklist 
for this level of consultation is impossible .25  Instead, FPIC provides a framework with sufficient 
flexibility to adapt to different scenarios , which would prove  extremely helpful to modern treaty 
rights holders, proponents, regulators and Crown representatives navigating  the consultation 
process. I t would s ave time and resources dedicated to figuring out what qualifies as deep 
consultation.

 23.  The diligent pursuit of the following six key elements  will support the achievement of 
deep consultation, enhance the certainty of treaty promises and promote the goal of 
reconciliation :  
a. Freedom from force, intimidation, manipulation, coercion or pressure by a proponent 
[Freedom];  
b. Mutual agreement on a process for consultation [Procedural Consensus];26  
c. Robust and satisfactory engagement with the Aboriginal group prior to approval 
[Robust Engagement];27 
d. Sufficient and timely information exchange [Information and Understanding];28 
e. Proper resourcing, both technical and financial, to allow the Aboriginal group to meaningfully participate [Meaningful Participation];
29  
f. Shared  objective of obtaining the reasonable consent of the Aboriginal group [Objective 
of Consent].30  This is an  overarching objective that serves as a guide for the process as 
a whole.  
24. The Freedom  element reflects the fact that consent cannot be valid if it is extracted 
through force, threats , or intimidation. In Canada, we are fortunate to have a strong legal 
framework already in place that addresses this concern.  Nevertheless this element is esse ntial to 
a meaningful process  of consent .  A conceivable infringement of this element could be  a threat  to 
withhold emergency  services  unless consent is given to a development project within a rights 
holder’s settlement area.  
25. The Procedural Consensus element requires the Crown and the rights holders to come to 
a common understanding about what steps are required to obtain reasonable consent. This 
includes accommodati ng the needs of the participant Aboriginal group, for example by setting  a 
schedule  for consultation  that provides for different harvesting seasons  or days of importance . In 
line with Haida, “at all stages, good faith on both sides is required”.31 A requirement to work in  
good faith to determine a reasonable process work s as a limit on the unreasonable intransigence 
of one or both parties . While this element may add time and effort at the front end of the 
consultation, procedural consensus will help manage expectations and maintain focus  on the 
objective of reasonable consent.

 26. Robust Engagement must “take place before the government authorizes or a company 
undertakes or commits to undertake any activity related to the project within Indigenous territory 
or other lands subject to Indigenous rights.”32 It requires the commitment of  time, energy and  
resources to understand the positions and interests of the Aboriginal group. The objective of 
obtaining reasonable consent drives the entity seeking that consent to invest in fostering  a 
working relationship with, teaching and learning fr om the Aboriginal party.  
27. The Information and Understanding element is necessarily multidirectional. It requires 
an exchange of information on the nature of the project, as well as a demonstrated understanding of the Aboriginal right at stake and the specific nature of the potential impacts on the Aboriginal 
interests in question, including impacts on the rights of future generations.
33 While it is 
incumbent upon the Crown to furnish Aboriginal parties with information about the project, the 
Crown also has a responsibility to receive and understand project concerns – including those 
based in Traditional Knowledge – from the rights holders. This exchange will necessarily affect  
the Crown’s decision to accept an Aboriginal party’s non- consent or, on the ot her hand, the 
Crown’s justification of its decision to proceed without that consent  under the Sparrow  analysis 
discussed below .  
28. Consultation must be in good faith and with the intention of substantially addressing the 
concerns of the A boriginal peoples whose lands  and rights  are at issue.34 As such, the Crown has 
a duty to ensure that the representations of Aboriginal peoples are seriously considered.35 This is 
the principle  that the Information and Understanding element targets.  
29. To satisfy the  Meaningful Participation  element, attention must be given to the 
“implications of power imbalances.”36 The party seeking to obtain consent must ensure  that the 
treaty rights holder has adequate financial and technical resources to responsibly  study the risks 
and rewar ds of a proposed development  on present and future generations , to understand their 
legal rights with respect to the proposal , and to prese nt their positions for consideration. In order 
for an Aboriginal  people to meaningfully participate , the Crown must provide them with a 
reasonable amount of time commensurate with the significance of the possible impacts.

 30. The Objective of Consent  requirement often attracts the most controversy, as this has 
been misinterpreted by some groups a s a veto for rights holders . A unilateral veto , however,  
would provide for arbitrary decision- making, which is fundamentally inconsistent with free, 
prior and informed consent and with the Canadian jurisprudence. Consent in FPIC is not a 
binary , yes or no, concept. Rather, “consent is a complex process of building a relationship, 
exchanging information, conducting analysis” and fully integrating an Aboriginal community in 
the process of discussion, analysis and decision- making.37 The objective of consent acts as 
overarching guide to the FPIC process.  
31. In Mikisew , the Court reiterated that “consultation will not always lead to 
accommodation, and accommodation may or may not result in an agreement”.38 Similarly, the 
Special Rapporteur has explained that FPIC should not be regarded as according a general “veto 
power” over decisions, but rather as establishing consent as the objective of consultations with 
indigenous peoples.39  
32. The Honourable Frank Iacobucci recently emphasi zed that the s tandard for consultation 
that FPIC embodies is consultation with the objective of consent : “While a veto enables arbitrary 
and uninformed decisions and inhibits meaningful consultation, consultation in the aim of 
achieving consent emphasizes meaningful and  informed dialogue and accommodation”.40 The 
emphasis is on bona fide  negotiations toward mutually acceptable arrangements where both 
parties have a real opportunity to influence the decision. The  impetus of working to achieve 
consent drives the parties tow ard meaningful consultation based on  respect  for each party ’s role 
and status.  
33. The focus of FPIC on obtaining reasonable consent is consistent with this Court’s 
statements that in some cases, consent of an Aboriginal group may be required or 
advantageous.41 This ensures that the consultation is more than merely an opportunity to “blow

 off steam.”42 Consultation has to be meaningful43 in order to satisfy the duty to consult and 
accommodate. FPIC is a means to achieve this and a standard against which to assess  it.  
34. As expressed in Tsilhqot’in , consent is the mechanism that will offer most certainty not 
only to those who wish to pursue a project that may have a significant impact on express 
Aboriginal rights ,44 but also to those Aboriginal peoples who have negotiated a land claims 
agreement. Consultation with the objective of obtaining consent provides more certainty, and is more consistent with international legal  principles of self -determination for indigenous  
peoples.
45 
35. Furthermore, because the concept of reasonableness is one of the most widely used 
concepts in Canadian law, courts are well -equipped to assess decisions on a standard of 
reasonableness where an indigenous government withholds consent.46 This prom otes certainty of 
decisions for all parties, encourages balance, and sets a clear and familiar standard for the 
Crown, indigenous groups, and third parties.  
36. In the case of deep consultation and proven rights, the FPIC framework also provides a 
sensible wa y to integrate the duty to consult and accommodate with the duty of the Crown not to 
infringe proven rights without justification. If the Crown proves  that it has diligently pursued the 
requirements of FPIC and the Aboriginal party withheld its consent unr easonably, then the 
approval may proceed . 
37. If the Aboriginal group withholds its consent, but does so reasonably, there are two 
options:  
a. The Crown accepts the decision and the project does not go ahead;  
b. The Crown proceeds with the decision/project without t he consent of the 
Aboriginal group if the Crown is able to justify the infringement of the Aboriginal 
interest under the Sparrow  framework.47

 38. IRC submits that the record produced through the application of the FPIC principles 
would appropriately inform the justification analysis to allow for a  realistic balancing of present 
and future public and Aboriginal interests. This will also promote predictability and fairness.   
D. FPIC Supports Implementation of Treaties and Reconciliation  
39. In Manitoba Métis Federation Inc. v . Canada (Attorney General) , this Court held that the 
honour of the Crown governs treaty implementation and requires the Crown to act in a way that 
accomplishes the intended purposes of the treaty. The honour of the Crown further requires that 
the Crown take a broad , purposive approach to the interpretation of the promise and to act 
diligently to fulfill it. Crown servants, therefore, “must seek to perform the obligation in a way that pursues the purpose behind the promise.”
48 
40. IRC submits th at, where modern treaty rights are at stake and deep consultation is 
required, consulting with the objective of obtaining the reasonable consent of an Aboriginal 
people is consistent with the Crown’s obligations to diligently fulfill treaty promises.49 By 
implementing the principle of free, prior and informed consent, parties are engaged in “the 
building of confidence and mutual respect.”50  
41. FPIC also promotes reconciliation by encouraging Aboriginal peoples to continue to 
enter into modern treaties. By setting reasonable consent as the shared objective of the 
consultation process, FPIC supports the alignment of the goals of both parties. Not only will this 
help to facilitate the success of the consultation process, but it will also provide cert ainty that the 
compromise that indigenous groups have made through negotiated land claims settlements will 
be respected. Aboriginal communities would have an assured and specified role, as well as more 
precise powers and responsibilities. In this way, FPIC contributes to productive and peaceful 
Nation -to-Nation relationships.
