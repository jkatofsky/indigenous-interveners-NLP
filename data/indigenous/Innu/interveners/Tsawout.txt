PART I – STATEMENT OF FACTS  
1. Tsawout First Nation adopts the facts set out in the Appellant’s factum.  
PART II – POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPELLANT’S QUESTIONS  
2. Tsawout First Nation supports the Appellant’s position that an action seeking a 
declaration of Aboriginal title constitutes a “real” or “ in rem” action .  However, Tsawout 
First Nation supports the Respondents’ position that claims for Aboriginal rights short of 
title, are best characterized as “mixed” or “ in personam ” claims.  
PART III – STATEMENT  OF ARGUMENT  
 
 
A. Principles That Should  be Applied in the Disposition of this Appeal  
3. In Sparrow , the court accepted that  section 35(1) of the Constitution Act , be construed in 
a purposive way : 
Section 35 calls for a just settlement for aboriginal peoples. It  renounces the old 
rules of the game under which the Crown established courts of law and denied 
those courts the authority to questions sovereign claims made by the Crown.1 
4. This appeal raises important issues regarding the promise of section 35, the enforc eability 
of Aboriginal rights and title and treaty rights, and access to justice.  
5. The answers to the questions raised in this appeal should be guided by the following 
principles: 1) While “section 35(1) provides a solid constitutional base on which 
subsequ ent negotiations can take place,”2 courts must be careful not to limit access  to the 
courts  when negotiations break down ; 2) Aboriginal peoples seeking court remedies for 
actions that diminish or negatively affect their section 35 rights should, subject to  
jurisdictional rules, have access to the courts of their home province; 3) Section 35 rights, 
to have meaning, must be capable of being enforced against private parties, without the 
necessity of having to first prove the existence of the right(s) and thei r unjustified 
infringement .  
                                                 
1 R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075 [“ Sparrow ”] at p. 1106  
2 Sparrow  at p. 1105.   2 
 
B. Aboriginal Title  Claims are in Rem   
6. Aboriginal title is an independent pre -existing legal right that does not depend on the 
Royal Proclamation , treaty, executive order or legislative enactment.3 
7. While the Delgamuukw  decision di d not specifically address the in rem  nature of 
Aboriginal title claims, the judgment clearly contemplates a real property right:  
This Court has taken pains to clarify that aboriginal title is only “personal” in this 
sense [i.e. in the sense of being inalienable], and does not mean that aboriginal 
title is a non -proprietary interest, which amounts to no more than a licence to use 
and occupy land and cannot compete on an equal footing with ot her proprietary 
interests ; see Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Paul,  [1988] 2 S.C.R 654 at p. 677 .4  
8. The only definitive statement on the nature of Aboriginal title comes from the Calder  
trial decision, where Gould J. held that the Aboriginal title action brought by the Nisga’a 
Nation was “ in rem, qua  the state of title to the lands in question.”5 This statement was 
not questioned by either the Court of Appeal or Supreme Court of Canada.  
9. This court has held that Aboriginal title is a right to land  itself, protected under section 
35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  A declaration of Aboriginal title provides the First 
Nation with a right to the e xclusive use and occupation  of land.6   
10. In Tsilhqot’in  this court state d that: 
Aboriginal title confers ownership  rights similar to those associated with fee 
simple, including: the right to decide how the land will be used; the right of 
enjoyment and occupancy of the land; the right to possess the land; the right to the 
economic benefits of the land; and the r ight to proactively manage  the land.

11. These descriptions of Aboriginal title clearly indicate that it is real property right , sui 
generis  in nature that goes beyond the incidents of fee simple to include governance 
rights as well .8   
12. Lower courts have been grappling with the nature of Aboriginal title claims, usually in 
the context of applications by the Crown to provide notice to third parties who may have 
legal interests with in areas claimed by First Nations .   
13. In Willson , the Plainti ffs sought a declaration that the western boundary of the land 
encompassed by Treaty No. 8 is the Arctic -Pacific Watershed. An issue arose as to 
whether the judgment sought by the Plaintiffs was in rem  or in personam  and whether 
notice was required to be p rovided to other Treaty No. 8 beneficiaries. After reviewing 
the authorities, the court held that :  
I conclude that the declaration sought in this case, if granted, would result in a 
decision in rem , good against all persons, whether or not parties to the action. 
This makes it important, as a matter of fairness, that those signatories and 
adherents to Treaty 8, whose interests will be affected by the declarations sought, 
be given an opportunity to be heard.9 
14. While Willson  was decided in the Treaty contex t, subsequent cases that have considered 
the issue of notice to third parties have raised concerns regarding the potential 
unwieldiness of inviting private landowners , whose interests may be affected,  to 
participate in the litigation.10   
15. The courts are well -equipped to address situations when Aboriginal title and fee simple 
collide. In William , the court addressed how private interests ought to be dealt with:  
Any tenure holder’s interest derives from the interest of British Columbia. If the 
plaintiff’s aboriginal rights and title affect the title and interest of British 
Columbia, then the interests of tenure holders are also affected. If they have 
something les s than they bargained for, their remedy does not lie in joining this 
action to attack the interests of the plaintiff. All parties defending specific claims 
                                                 
8 Kent McNeil, “ Aboriginal Title  as a Constitutionally Protected Property Right ”, Lippert, Owen, 
ed., Beyond the Nass Valley: National Implications of the Supreme Court’s Delgamuukw 
Decision (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2000), p. 55 -75. 
9 Willson v. British Columbia,  2007 BCSC 1324  [“Willson ”] at para. 43.  
10 William  v. Riverside Forest Products, 2002 BCSC 1199 [“ William ”] at paras. 14 -15. 4 
 
will make arguments against the interests of the plaintiff. Those arguments do not 
improve with repe tition by others against whom no claim is advanced.11  
16. While each case must be dealt with based on its specific facts, in William , the court held 
that the Crown was capable of defending the interests of private landowners, given their 
interest in avoiding l iability for granting defective titles. 
17. However, in recent case s, the Supreme Court of British Columbia  has taken a more 
nuanced approach . In Haida , the court stated that : 
The law is unsettled as to whether a declaration of aboriginal title is 
equivalent t o a judgment  in rem , but the principles in these cases 
support the proposition that such a declaration made in this action 
would only be binding on non -parties with an interest in the lands 
affected if they had received formal notice of the claim. In the 
absence of such notice, third parties would be free to raise all 
defences should the plaintiffs later elect to make claims against them.  
Moreover, if a declaration of aboriginal title is equivalent to a 
declaration of ownership as against the named defendan ts only, as 
suggested by the plaintiffs, it would follow that its scope would be 
limited.12 
18. Rather than squarely addressing the nature of an Aboriginal title declaration, the courts 
have been content to “kick the can down the road.”13 This approach does not further the 
objective of reconciliation.   
19. Characterizing Aboriginal Title  as in personam  or simply sui generis,  raises  the potential 
for uncertainty in the law, particularly in situations where claims are brought that impact 
not simply on “Crown lands” but fee simple and other tenures. As the courts have noted, 
allowing multiple third parties to be joined as defendants ma y make Aboriginal title 
claims non -justiciable. Other the other hand,  the First Nation may invest millions of 
dollars to prove its Aboriginal title, yet be faced with  the possibility that it may have  to 
bring further claims against third party tenure holde rs to vindicate their declaration of 
Aboriginal title.14

para. 24; Haida at para. 50.  
14 For example, Cowichan Tribes  at para. 24; Haida at para. 50.  5 
 
20. The co -existence of Aboriginal title and private  ownership  need not be a zero -sum game.  
As Professor Borrows suggests there  are several possibilities as to how fee simple and 
Aboriginal title might co-exist.15 
21. While Aboriginal title is in rem , it is not absolute. This court has acknowledged the  
Crown’s role in balancing Aboriginal title interests with public interest under the 
Tsilhqot’in test for justification, if that interest is compelling and subs tantial.16   
22. Aboriginal title claims constitute “real”  / in rem claims. Not only are Aboriginal title 
claims “real ,” they are constitutional in nature by virtue of section 35(1). Characterizing 
such claims as in personam  is inconsistent with the  source of Aboriginal title, this court’s  
jurisprudence , and, rather than furthering reconciliation, has the potential to create 
uncertainty and further litigation.   
C. Aboriginal Rights Claims are in Personam  
23. Aboriginal rights claims , short of title, are properly  classified as “mixed ” or in personam  
in nature .   
24. This court has cautioned applying traditional common law concepts of property when 
defining Aboriginal rights:  
Aboriginal and treaty rights cannot be defined in a manner which would accord 
with common law concepts of title to land or the right to use another’s land. 
Rather, they are the right of aboriginal people in common with other aboriginal 
people to participat e in certain practices traditionally engaged in by particular 
aboriginal nations in particular territories.17 
25. The Adams  case sets out a spectrum of Aboriginal  rights , short of title, that may still be 
connected to specific tracts of land.  While this court recognized that Aboriginal rights, in 
particular rights to hunt and fish, can be site -specific, that does not mean that such rights 
are necessarily in rem .18

Osgoode’s Annual Constitutional Cases Conference  71. (2015) at p. 130.   
16 Tsilhqot’in at paras. 81 -87. 
17 R. v. Sundown , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 393 at para. 35. Importantly, these comments were made in the 
context of Aboriginal and Treaty rights short of Title.  
18 R. v. Adams, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 101 [“ Adams ”] at para. 30.  6 
 
26. Numerous  Aboriginal cases have held that Aboriginal rights will frequently be lim ited to 
a specific geographical area.19 Harvesting rights are often, by their nature, site -specific. In 
Adams , the site -specific Aboriginal right was a right to fish in Lake St. Francis. In  
Sparrow , the appellant was fishing in Canoe Passage on the Fraser R iver, “in the ancient 
tribal territory where his ancestors had fished from time immemorial.”20 
27. The key point is that Aboriginal and Treaty rights, while often tied to specific sites, 
generally do not rise to an exclusive  property right.   
28. While the First Na tion may have section 35 rights to fish or hunt in a particular location, 
they may have to do so in common with other First Nations as well as  non-Indigenous 
hunters and fishers. What makes Aboriginal rights different is that , inter alia , they are 
constitu tionally protected and , in the event of conflict amongst users, th e doctrine of 
priority as set out in Sparrow  applies .21   
29. The fact that Aboriginal and Treaty rights may be exercised in a different jurisdiction 
from the First Nations’ domicile should not require the First Nation to bring such claims 
in multiple court proceedings .  
30. As this court has noted, borders are the const ruction of “newcomers” and Aboriginal 
rights, which are based on aboriginal practices, customs and traditions preceded contact.22 
Similarly, many treaties preceded the establishment of provincial boundaries, for example 
Treaty No.  8, such that First Nations  may exercise their rights across provincial and 
territorial boundaries . 
 
D. Access to Justice Considerations  
31. As the courts below noted, t his appeal  raises important access to justice issues.  If the 
appeal is allowed, First Nations will be forced to bring mu ltiple claims in multiple

jurisdictions , in circumstances where the underlying facts and issues are identical, save 
that the activities cross  jurisdiction al boundaries .23   
32. In Adams , the court set out an approach to be taken when considering limitations on 
section 35 rights:  
As with limitations of the rights enshrined in the Charter , limits on the aboriginal 
rights protected by s. 35(1) must be informed by the same purposes which 
underlie the decision to  entrench those rights in the Constitution to be 
justifiable...Those purposes are the recognition of the prior occupation of North 
America by aboriginal peoples, and the reconciliation of prior occupation by 
aboriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown s overeignty.24  
33. While th ese comments were made in the context of justification for infringement of 
Aboriginal rights, th e overarching purposes  of section 35(1)  - recognition and 
reconciliation  - have broad application to this appeal.   
34. In Telezon e, this court cautioned that meaningful access to justice requires that: 
People who claim to be injured by government action should have whatever 
redress the legal system permits through procedures that minimize unnecessary 
cost and complexity. The Court's approac h should be practical and pragmatic with 
that objective in mind.  
……  
Access to justice requires that the claimant be permitted to pursue its chosen 
remedy directly and, to the greatest extent possible, without procedural detours.25 
 
35. Although  Telezone  and its companion cases  dealt with issues arising from the concurrent 
jurisdiction of t he Federal Court and the provincial superior courts, th eir concern about 
access to justice applies equally  when resolving issues relating to  concurrent jurisdiction 
among the superior courts . Fundamentally,  where a plaintiff’s pleading in a provincial 
superior court alleges the elements of a private cause of action for damages, that plaintiff 
is normally en titled to pursue it .26

36. Further, i n Strickland , this court affirmed  Telezone and applied its principles to find that a 
provincial  superior  court could  determine  the validity of a federal regulation , an issue 
intended to be within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Federal Court , where such 
determination is a neces sary step in disposing of proceedings properly before it.27 This 
kind of pragmatic solution can further  access to justice by enabling complex multi -
jurisdictional disputes to be resolved without a multiplicity of proceedings.  
37. Aboriginal rights exist within the general legal system of Canada ,28 and often by their 
geographic nature give rise to disputes spanning multiple jurisdictions. Recognizing 
Aboriginal rights under section 35 (1) requires that a First Nation have access to the courts 
when necessary, to rec oncile those rights  with Canadian society . Creating artificial 
barriers to justice does nothing to further to reconciliation process at the heart of section 
35(1). 
38. In this appeal, access to justice requires that a claimant with Aboriginal rights located 
across two jurisdictions be permitted to pursue claim s for declaratory relief and damages 
in respect of their Aboriginal and Treaty  rights directly, rather than be forced to suffer the 
delay, expense and uncertainty of an “awkward and duplicative two -court  procedure .”29  
39. Aboriginal rights short of Aboriginal title are sui generis or in personam  in nature . 
Subject to the particular rules of court  and conflict of laws  considerations, eg. forum non 
conveniens , First Nations should be able to bring an action in the superior court of the 
province in which they reside, even in circumstances where their claims may be based on 
activities  that take place in another jurisdiction .   
40. As the courts below held, First Nations should be able to seek remedies from third parties 
for private law torts, such as nuisance, trespass and negligence , without having to first 
seek a court declaration of their rights. Tsawout agrees that the approach taken by the 
Quebec Court of Appeal  and the Court of Appeal for British Columbia to such claims is 
correct  and consistent with providing access to justice .30
