 PART I – OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF  FACTS  
1. The Appellant, the Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador, brings this appeal 
challenging the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Qu ébec to adjudicate and rule upon claims 
against private defendants that are grounded and dependent on the assertion of Aboriginal rights 
and title (hereinafter, “section 35 claims”) over property, land, and natural resources situated 
within the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (“NL”).1 
2. While the present appeal concerns the  assertion  of section 35 claims against private 
parties, it raises broader  issues respecting the ability of A boriginal groups to bring forward and 
resolve section 35 claims  that span more than one jurisdiction . Both the motions judge and the 
Québec Court of Appeal identified the practical barriers inherent in the advancement of multi -
jurisdictional section 35 claims as a fundamental access to justice issue .2 
3. The Interveners Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg (“KZA”)  and the Algonquin Anishinabeg 
Tribal Council  (“AANT C”) do not take a position on the disposition of this appeal. Rather, KZA 
and AANTC’s submissions address  the practical challenges Aboriginal groups face in 
reconciling their Aboriginal rights and title in more than one province , underscore the need for 
this Court to provide  judicial guidance to lower courts  and the Crown  to manage and resolve 
these claims  within Canada’s constitutional framework , and offer  examples of such solutions in 
Canadian and international law.  
4. The practical barriers inherent in the advancement of multi -jurisdictional section 35 
claims also mean there are likely to be few opportunities for this Court to consider these issues 
and to provide judicial guidance. In KZA and AANTC’s submission, this  appeal presents a 
unique and valuable opportunity for this Court to do just that.

1PART II – QUESTION IN ISSUE  
5. As noted above, KZA and AANTC do not take a position with respect to the question 
posed by the Appellant in this a ppeal , but rather see this a ppeal as an opportunity to seek 
guidance on multi- jurisdictional section 35 claims, a formidable issue facing KZA, AANTC , and 
other Aboriginal groups in Canada.  
PART II I – ARGUMENT  
A. Barriers to  multi -jurisdictional Aboriginal rights and title claims  
6. Many Aboriginal groups in Canada, including KZA , AANTC , and the Respondents, have 
traditional territory  and, consequently, section 35 rights  spanning more than one province . These  
constitutionally -protected rights predate and survived European settlement .3 As the motions 
judge in this appeal noted, these rights were exercised without regard to Canadian borders.4 
7. From the perspective of Aboriginal groups, colonial (and later Canadian)  borders were 
imposed upon Indigenous peoples  without their consent , arbitrarily divid ing up their territory. In 
Mitchell v Minister of National R evenue, Binnie, J., ( concurring) , noted the frustrations of the 
Mohawks of Akwesasne  as a result of  the jurisdictional divisions separating  their community 
between Québec, Ontario, and New York State:  
[T]he purpose of s. 35(1) of the Constitution 
Act, 1982 is to reconcile “the pre- existence of 
aboriginal societies with the sovereignty of the 
Crown”. In this respect, the respondent argued 
with some passion in the witness box that the 
jurisdictional divisions carry deeper meaning 
for the  Mohawks of Akwesasne because they 
represent the intrusion of non- aboriginal 
governing institutions in the everyday life of 
Akwesasne and their relations with other 
members of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois 
Confederacy). The border complexities are a 
constant reminder to the Mohawks of their 
frustration and inability to control the destiny [L]e paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi 
constitutionnelle de 1982 vise à «concilier la 
préexistence des sociétés autochtones et la 
souveraineté de Sa Majes té». À cet égard, 
l'intimé a soutenu avec une certaine passion à la barre des témoins que la dislocation entre 
ressorts territoriaux a une signification plus 
profonde pour les Mohawks d'Akwesasne 
parce qu'elle représente l'intrusion d'institutions gouverne
mentales non autochtones dans leur 
vie de tous les jours à Akwesasne et dans leurs 
relations avec d'autres membres de 
Haudenosaunee (Confédération iroquoise). Les 
complexités frontalières rappellent

8. Canada’s constitutional structure creates significant legal obstacles  for Aboriginal 
claimant s with multi- jurisdictional section 35 claims . Each province owns and controls  the 
“lands, mines, minera ls, and royalties”  situated within its borders ,6 and t he principle of  Crown 
immunity precludes the courts of one province from making determinations against the Crown of 
another province.7 The combined effect of these factors  requires a multi- jurisdictiona l section 35 
claimant , should they wish to pursue the entirety of their claim,  to bring separate court actions, 
even where the lands may be geographically contiguous.  
9. There are also regulatory and legislative hurdles  to bring ing multiple actions on 
essent ially the same subject matter. Both courts and legislatures have indicated that duplicative 
proceed ings are to be avoided,8 and, in some cases, can amount to an abuse of process .9 
Duplicative proceedings  run contrary to the principle of judicial economy,10 as well as  offend  the 
proportionality principle reflected in many provinces’ rules of procedure  (to secure the just, most 
expeditious, and least expensive determination of civil proceedings on their merits).11

Procedure , RSQ, c C-25.01, art 18. 
310. In the appeal at bar, the motions judge and th e Québec Court of Appeal expressed 
concerns about the Respondents having to bring multiple actions in Qu ébec and NL: 
Peut-on dire qu'il est dans l'intérêt de la justice qu'essentiellement le même débat 
ait lieu devant deux juridictions qui doivent toutes les deux appliquer la même loi, 
et ce, quand les tribunaux qui entendront les causes sont tous les deux de 
nomination fédérale?12 
11.  The requirement to bring multiple actions also exacerbates an existing problem inherent 
in section 35 rights  litigation , namely  the significant cost  and time  of prosecuting the action. 
Aboriginal rights and title  litigation, by its very nature, is inherently complex and require s years 
and even decades to resolve in the courts.13 Adjudicating section 35 claims  almost invariably  
requires extensive documentary and oral evidence, costly  expert opinion evidence, and numerous 
pre-trial motions .14 With multiple actions, the claimant would also have to navigate the rules of 
civil procedure in two different jurisdictions, erecting further bar riers to advancing their claim.  
12. A related  problem of pursuing multiple actions for multi -jurisdictional section 35 claims  
is the risk of the inconsistent interpretation of evidence  and, consequently, the potential for 
inconsistent outcomes . The motions judge below  emphasized  this issue.15 Aboriginal rights and 
title claims require proof of historical and pre -historical facts, which in turn requires both oral 
historical evidence , as well as  expert opinion evidence .16 As the courts below noted, most, if not 
all, of this historical evidence is likely to apply equally to a claim in both jurisdictions ; yet, 
instead of one unified action, an A boriginal group must pursue a separate claim in each 
jurisdiction using the same historical evidence .17

Appeal Decision, supra note 2 at  para 116, AR Vol I at 52.  
413. With  multiple claims  where the same or very similar evidence is considered , there exists 
a risk of courts  interpret ing the same evidence differently . This could lead to inconsistent 
findings of fact, which is contrary to the interests of justice and could erode public confide nce in 
the judicial process itself, thereby diminishing the judiciary’s  authority, the credibility  of the 
process , and the aim of finality .18 This risk is particularly acute in the context of  section 35 
claims,  as much of the evidence  concerns historical documents, the interpretation of which 
informs the foundation of Aboriginal rights and title claims. 
14. In KZA and AANTC’s submission, the foregoing  problems amount to a serious access to 
justice  and proportionality  issue for Aboriginal claimants with multi-jur isdictional section 35 
claims . These problems  form a practical barrier to the bringing  and adjudication of  these claims  
on their merits  in the Canadian court system .19 As this Court noted in Hryniak v Mauldin : 
“[W]ithout an accessible public forum for the adjudication of disputes, the rule of law is 
threatened and the development of the common law undermined”  (“en l'absence d'un forum 
public accessible pour faire trancher les litiges, la primauté du droit est compromise et l'évolution 
de la common law, frein ée”).20 
15. These practical challenges for advancing  multi- jurisdictional section 35 claims also act  as 
a barrier to reconciliation. A key  purpose of the constitutional entrenchment of Aboriginal rights 
in section 35 is to recognize and reconcile these rights w ith the assertion of Crown sovereignty 
over Canadian territory.21 Without a practical and reasonable way to bring and manage multi -
jurisdictional claims, the goal of reconciliation cannot be achieved.22

22 See Truth and Reconciliati on Canada, Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: 
Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (Winnipeg: 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, 2015) volume 1 (“[a] commitment to truth and 
reconciliati on demands that Canada’s legal system be transformed” at 205). 
516. The combination of the above -noted barriers effectivel y prohibit s Aboriginal claimants 
from brin ging multi- jurisdictional section 35 claims . 
B. The need for judicial guidance and creative solutions  
17. The need for guidance with respect to  multi- jurisdictional section 35 claims  is imperative , 
to further  access to j ustice, achieve proportionality, and bolster reconciliation. T his is especially 
important given that section 35 rights are constitutionally  enshrined .    
18. KZA and AANTC do not suggest that the solution to these problems lies in disregarding 
longstanding constitutional principles of federalism or Crown immunity, but rather that the 
principles of access to justice, proportionality, and reconcil iation require courts and parties  to 
prioritize finding solutions to the jurisdictional and procedural problems inhere nt in these claims. 
Without judicial guidance from this Court  to do so, both courts and parties alike may be reluctant 
to engage to develop these solutions. 
19. In the A boriginal context, courts have underscored the importance of finding creative 
solutions to deal with the unique problems inherent in A boriginal rights litigation. For example, 
in Hereditary Chiefs Tony Hunt et al v Attorney General of Canada et al , Satanove J. of the 
British Columbia Supreme Court commented: 
I think it must be recognized that just as aboriginal rights are sui generis , 
aboriginal rights litigation is also unique. It involves hundreds of years of history 
and sometimes unconventional techniques of fact finding. It involves lofty, often elusive concepts of law such as the fiduciary d uty and honour of the Crown. We 
cannot simply view aboriginal claims in the same light as other civil litigation . I 
believe effective case management of aboriginal litigation requires an effort on 
behalf of all parties and the court to find a creative way to try the issues without 
invoking oppressive conduct that deters the plaintiffs or prejudices the 
defendants.23 
20. For its part, this Court has given similar judicial guidance to address multi -jurisdictional 
problems raised in class action  litigation . In Canada Post Corp v Lépine , this Court drew 
attention to the issue of the lack of cooperation between jurisdictions with respect to managing 
multi- jurisdictional class actions:  
23 Hereditary Chiefs Tony Hunt et al v Attorney General of Canada et al , 2006 BCSC 1368 at 
para 2 6 [emphasis added] . 
6[T]he creation of national classes also raises 
the issue of relations between equal but 
different superior courts in a federal system in which civil procedure and the administration of 
justice are under provincial jurisdiction. This 
case shows that the decisions made may 
sometimes cause friction between courts in 
different provinces. This  of course often 
involves problems with communications or 
contacts between the courts and between the 
lawyers involved in such proceedings. 
However, the provincial legislatures should 
pay more attention to the framework for 
national class actions and the p roblems they 
present. More effective methods for managing jurisdictional disputes should be established in 
the spirit of mutual comity that is required 
between the courts of different provinces in the Canadian legal space. It is not this Court’s role to de
fine the necessary solutions. However, it 
is important to note the problems that 
sometimes seem to arise in conducting such 
actions.  [L]a création des groupes nationaux pose aussi 
le problème des rapports entre tribunaux 
supérieurs égaux, mais différents, dans un 
système fédéral où la procédure civile et 
l'administration de la justice relèvent des 
provinces. Le présent dossier montre que les 
décisions rendues peuvent parfois provoquer 
des frictions entre les tribunaux de différentes provinces. Il s'agit san
s doute souvent de 
problèmes de communication ou de contact 
entre les tribunaux et entre les avocats engagés 
dans ces procédures. Cependant, les 
législatures provinciales devraient porter plus 
d'attention au cadre des recours collectifs 
nationaux et aux pr oblèmes posés par ceux -ci. 
Des méthodes plus efficaces de gestion des 
conflits de compétence devraient être établies 
dans l'esprit de courtoisie mutuelle qui 
s'impose entre les tribunaux des différentes 
provinces dans l'espace juridique canadien. Il 
ne nous appartient pas de définir les solutions nécessaires. Il importe cependant de relever les difficultés qui semblent parfois se poser dans la 
conduite de ces recours.24 
 
21. For all the practical difficulties described herein regarding the advancement of multi-
jurisdictional section 35 claims , this appeal presents this Court with a rare opportunity to provide 
much needed judicial guidance on a pervasive national issue.  
C. Examples of creative and practical solutions to multi- jurisdictional issues  
22. While there is little, if any, jurisprudence on multi -jurisdictional section 35 claims in 
Canadian law  aside from this a ppeal,  Canadian  class action litigation and Canadian and 
international Aboriginal law provide examples  of solutions for managing multi- jurisdictional 
claims .  
24 Lépine v Société Canadienne des postes , 2009 SCC 16 at para 57 [emphasis ad ded].  
7i. Multi- jurisdictional hearings  and communication between courts  
23. In Endean v British Columbia,25 class counsel brought three separate motions in the 
superior courts  of British Columbia, Québec , and Ontario to approve a protocol extending the 
deadline fo r filing claims under a national settlement agreement . They  proposed that the three 
supervising judges of each province hear the motions concurrently, sitting together in one 
location.26 In restoring the order of the motions judge , this Court held that superior court judges 
have the jurisdiction to sit extra -provincially and hear motions in a different province , permitting 
the three judges to hear the motion in one location simultaneously.27 
24. Similarly, in  three parallel class action claims involving allegatio ns of price fixing of 
dynamic random -access memory  devices (the “DRAM Actions”), judges of the superior courts 
of British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec concurrently heard motions to approve a settlement  by 
videoconference.28 Following the motion, each justi ce rendered his or her  own separate 
decision.29  
25. In the United States , the Wisconsin Teague v Bad River Band line of cases is  an example 
of courts working together in novel ways to address jurisdictional challenges involving Aboriginal claims.
30 The cases  involved questions of whether a t ribal court or a Wisconsin state 
court had jurisdiction over the claims at issue  and led to the creation of “jurisdiction allocation 
conferences”, colloquially termed “Teague  conferences”, and the creation of a list of factor s for 
courts to consider to resolve jurisdictional issues between state and tribal courts.31 
ii. Cooperation between counsel and the courts to efficiently and cooperatively manage 
claims  
26. The Vioxx litigation is an example of class counsel cooperating to coordinate multiple 
class action proceedings in different provinces. In Setterington v Merck Fros st Canada Ltd, eight

31 Teague , ibid  at para 71.  
8class actions were commenced in Ontario with respect to the painkiller Vioxx.32 Six of these 
actions were consolidated and proceeded as a single action with an amalgamated counsel team 
from nineteen law firms based in nine provinc es across Canada (the “Setterington Group”).  
27. The DRAM Actions involved similar collaboration among class counsel. In those actions, 
class counsel from British Columbia, Ontario , and Québec cooperated to advance proceedings  in 
each province.33  
28. Aboriginal law has great potential for  collaborative counsel work in  manag ing complex 
claims and maximiz ing access to justice. Restoule v Canada (Attorney General) , a 2018 decision 
of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, illustrates  this potential.34 In that  case, the parties, 
including two different Crowns (Canada and Ontario), addressed the voluminous amount of documentary evidence by filing a joint book of  documents, including  approximately 30,000 
pages of primary sources and a similar volume of secondary source material.
35 Ontario Crown 
counsel collected and digitized  this joint documentary record, complete with digital search 
features.36 The Court  also held two weeks of hearings in A nishinaabe First Nation territories to 
allow Elders to testify in their communities, pursuant to a protocol the parties developed.37 The 
court noted that “the ways in which counsel and the parties cooperated [made] this trial a 
proceeding of respect and an exercise in reconciliation.”38  
D. Potential areas of guidance this Court could provide 
29. Given the unresolved status of many Aboriginal rights and title  claims, the fact that we 
are well into the 21st century, and in keeping with the aims of reconciliation, the  need for a 
coordinated approach to multi -jurisdictional section 35 claims is long overdue. Based on the 
foregoing examples from class action and Aboriginal law, KZA and AANTC respectfully
