 PART 1 - OVERVIEW 
1. The gravamen of this appeal is whether Aborig inal title is merely a small relic of history 
– a historical marker by the roadside, indicating that a First Nation once regularly and intensively 
used a particular patch of land – or whether it provides a viable  springboard for a First Nation in 
the modern economy. At issue is whether ultimatel y s. 35 provides “cultural security” to First 
Nations only to live as they once  did, or whether s. 35 also provides a foothold for First Nations 
seeking meaningful participation in contemporary Canada.  
2. In arriving at the former of these choi ces, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning was 
fundamentally inconsistent with th e trajectory of this Court’s ju risprudence and the case law and 
scholarship of which it has appr oved and on which it is based.  
3. A central error in the Court below was in its application of the common law test for 
Aboriginal title. In Delgamuukw ,1 this Court accepted Professor McNeil’s argument that “the 
fact of physical occupation is proof of possession at law, which in turn will ground title to the 
land”, which he had set out in his seminal text, Common Law Aboriginal Title .2 This basis for 
Aboriginal title is wholly grounded in the co mmon law and in the fact of a First Nation’s 
physical occupation of the land. This common law basi s for Aboriginal title is disconnected from 
any consideration of the laws or customs th e First Nation had in respect of that land.  
4. This Court only generally defined th e test for physical occupation in Delgamuukw , and 
later in Marshall; Bernard .3 In Delgamuukw , Lamer C.J. gave examples of evidence of physical 
occupation that ranged from “the construction of  dwellings through cultivation and enclosure of 
fields to regular use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting its 
resources”. He adopted Professo r Slattery’s admonition that “ one must take into account the 
group’s size, manner of life, materi al resources, and technological abilities, and the character of 
the lands claimed”.4 In Marshall; Bernard , McLachlin C.J. stressed that “[t]he aboriginal 
perspective grounds the analysis  and imbues its every step”.5

5 Marshall; Bernard , para 50.  2 
 
 5. The Court below made fundamental errors in the application of this common law test for 
Aboriginal title, as the Appella nt has correctly identified. For one  thing, the Court interpreted the 
threshold test of physical occupa tion as requiring “an intensive presen ce at a particular site”.6 For 
another, the Court of Appeal largely ignored this Court’s admonitions to view occupation 
through the lens of the First Nation’s “manner of life”.  
6. The error in the Court of Appeal’s judgmen t that will be focused on this factum, 
however, is the application of a test defined solely by the comm on law. The common law is but 
one basis for Aboriginal title. Another is the Fi rst Nation’s customary laws in relation to land, 
which may ground and define title to th at land in the First Nation. A third, sui generis  approach – 
the one adopted by this Court in Delgamuukw  – combines  these two bases for Aboriginal title, 
such that physical occupa tion and customary law are both relevant to proof of title.  
7. Professors Slattery and McNeil concur that th ese three approaches to Aboriginal title are 
the three leading theories and that the sui generis  theory endorsed by this Court in Delgamuukw  
is preferable to the other two.7 Both professors criticize this Court’s decision in Marshall; 
Bernard  for placing too much emphas is on physical occupation as the grounding for title claims,8 
and Professor McNeil is highly critical of the Cour t of Appeal’s definition of Aboriginal title and 
the test for proof of it in the case at bar.9  
8. In the balance of this factum, Gitxaala Nation set outs more fully the jurisprudential 
underpinnings of the customary law basis for Aborigin al title and the vital ro le it plays in the test 
for title that this Court laid down in Delgamuukw . Importantly to this appeal, the fact that 
Aboriginal title is rooted in part in Aboriginal la w underscores that it is  not just limited to 
particular sites, as the Court of Appeal found, but can be territor ial in scope.

 PART 2 - POSITION ON THE QUESTIONS IN ISSUE 
9. Gitxaala Nation supports the Appell ant’s appeal with respect to  the nature of Aboriginal 
title and agrees with the Appellant that the Cour t of Appeal erred by rest ricting title claims to 
particular sites. Gitxaala Nation takes no position in this appeal on the other issues.  
PART 3 - ARGUMENT 
A. The “Doctrine of Continuity”: the cust omary law basis for Aboriginal title 
10.  This Court long ago recognized  the fact that, “when the se ttlers came, the Indians were 
there, organized in societies and occupying the land as their forefathers had done for centuries”.10 
Aboriginal peoples did not ju st occupy land randomly or oppor tunistically; rather, their 
occupation was structured and based upon their laws, traditions and customs, as is the case with any organized society. Wh ile Aboriginal peoples physically  occupied the land and possessed it in 
fact, they also ordered that occupation of th e land through normative systems by which their 
possession of the land was rooted in and legitimated by their customary laws.  
11. While physical occupation in fact  is one possible basis for A boriginal title – the common 
law basis – another basis is that title “arises from the customary legal systems of particular Indigenous groups.”
11 As Professor Walters has stated, “[t]he use and occupancy model of 
aboriginal rights focuses upon use of land and resources alone, but the aboriginal conception of 
aboriginal rights flows from their perceptions of not just their use of, but their relationship  to, 
land and resources. This relationship is, in turn, defined by aboriginal ‘law.’”12 On this theory, a 
First Nation’s Aboriginal title is a reflection of that First Nation’s pre-sovereignty system of laws 
with respect to their lands, which ground and define its possession of its lands.  
12. While on this theory Aboriginal right s and title have their source in pre-sovereignty 
Aboriginal systems of law, they continue to have force post-sovereignty because the common 
                                                                                                                                             
9 McNeil, Territorial , 8-10.  
10 Calder v. Attorney-General of British Columbia , [1973] S.C.R. 313 at 328 per Judson J. for the majority. See also 
Hall J.’s judgment, particularly at 375-394 and 401-6.   
11 Slattery, Metamorphosis , p. 263. Professor Slattery refers to th is theory as the “customary” conception of 
Aboriginal title.  
12 Mark Walters, “British Imperial Constitutional Law and Aboriginal Rights: A Comment on Delgamuukw v.

 law recognizes those system s of law by virtue of the “Doctrine of Continuity”.13 The doctrine is 
part of British “imperial” or “colonial” common law regulating the recep tion of British law in 
newly-acquired colonies. Under th e doctrine, the establishment of the colony by the Crown does 
not automatically extinguish the former legal regi me; to the contrary, laws and rights under that 
regime continue until specifically repealed or replaced by the new regime. The rationales for the 
doctrine have been said to be the separati on of powers, the rule of law and fairness.14  
13. The Doctrine of Continuity is well-established in the case law and commentary,15 
although it has been unevenl y applied. At times it wa s said to apply only to colonies acquired by 
conquest or cession, as opposed to discovery or settlement; at ot her times it was held not to 
extend to peoples “so low in the scale of social organization that their usages and conceptions of 
rights and duties are not to be reconciled with th e institutions or the legal ideas of civilized 
society”.16 These limitations have at various times b een thought to deny the continuation of the 
laws and rights of the Aboriginal peoples of  North America and Australia, by way of the 
“fictions”17 of terra nullius . But it is now clear that the doctr ine applies to co lonies acquired by 
settlement as well as conquest,18 and that the common law recognizes the full range of 
Aboriginal interests, “even though those inte rests are of a kind unknown to English law”.19 
14. The Doctrine of Continuity has been  applied by Canadian courts, as in Connolly v. 
Woolrich ,20 in which Cree marriage customs were held to  be in force such that a settler’s second

 marriage under Christian rites was a nullity beca use his first marriage under Cree custom had not 
been dissolved. More recently, Justice McLachlin (as she then was) accurately summarized and then relied upon the Doctrine of Continuity as th e basis for Aboriginal ri ghts in her dissent in 
Van der Peet .
21 Later, writing for the majority of this Court in Mitchell v. M.N.R. , Chief Justice 
McLachlin founded her judgment squarely upon the doctrine.22  
15. The continuity of Aboriginal law has been e xplicitly found by courts to be the basis for 
Aboriginal title by some courts, most prominently by the High Court of Australia in Mabo . In 
that case, Justice Brennan stated for the majority: “Native title has its origin in and is given its content by the traditional laws acknowledged by and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous inhabitants of a territory . The nature and incidents of na tive title must be ascertained 
as a matter of fact by reference to those laws and customs.”
23 In Van der Peet , Chief Justice 
Lamer found Justice Brennan’s analysis of the basi s of aboriginal title to be “persuasive in the 
Canadian context”.24 After quoting the above statement from Mabo , the Chief Justice stated:25  
This position is the same as that being adopted here .  “Traditional laws” and 
“traditional customs” are those things passe d down, and arising, from the pre-existing 
culture and customs of aboriginal peoples.  The very meaning of the word “tradition” 
– that which is “handed down [fr om ancestors] to posterity”, The Concise Oxford 
Dictionary  (9th ed. 1995), – implies these origins for the customs and laws that the 
Australian High Court in Mabo  is asserting to be relevant  for the determination of the 
existence of aboriginal title.  To base abor iginal title in traditional laws and customs, 
as was done in Mabo , is, therefore, to base that title in the pre-existing societies of 
aboriginal peoples.  This is the same basis as  that asserted here for aboriginal rights. 
16. The advantage of the continuity of customary law approach to Aboriginal rights and title 
is that it properly respects the political and nor mative dimensions of pre-sovereignty Aboriginal 
societies. As Professor Slattery has stated, “A boriginal title is nothing if not grounded ultimately 
in the actual use and occupation of lands by Indigenous peoples under their laws .”26 But the 
continuity approach also has limitations. As seen in Mabo , “[t]he nature and incidents of native 
title must be ascertained as a matter of fact by reference to [the First Nation’s pre-sovereignty]

 laws and customs.” That basis of  title could lead to insurmountab le problems of proof for some 
First Nations, where clear evidence of their pre-s overeignty laws has not survived the intervening 
one and a half centuries. It would also lead to  a heterogeneous patchwork of titles across British 
Columbia, with the title of  each First Nation having different natures and incidents.27 
B. Delgamuukw : the sui generis  approach to Aboriginal title 
17. The sui generis  theory holds that Aboriginal title is  not an ordinary pr oprietary interest 
under English common law, but neither is it enti rely defined by a First Nation’s pre-sovereignty 
laws relating to land. It is rather “a distinctive form of title ... that gives an Indigenous group the 
exclusive right to possess a nd use its traditional lands  for such purposes as it sees fit, subject to 
the restriction that the lands cannot  be transferred to outsiders but may only be ceded to or shared 
with the Crown, which holds an  underlying title to the land.”28 
18. The sui generis  theory has a long pedigree, dating back to the Marshall decisions from 
the United States Supreme Court in the nineteenth century,29 in which Chief Justice Marshall 
held that the Indian peoples were “distinct, independent political communities, retaining their 
original natural rights, as the undisputed  possessors of the soil , from time immemorial,”30 subject 
to the limitation that they could only alienate thei r lands to the European power that “discovered” 
them. In Van der Peet , Chief Justice Lamer agreed that the Marshall decisions ar e “as relevant to 
Canada as they are to the United States”.31  
19. Chief Justice Lamer articulated the sui generis  theory of Aboriginal title further in 
Delgamuukw . He observed that Aborigin al title “cannot be completely explained by reference 
either to the common law rules of real property or to the rules of prope rty found in aboriginal 
legal systems”, but rather must be understood by reference to both legal regimes.32 While 
Aboriginal title has its source in the prior occupati on of Canada by Aboriginal peoples, both 
legal regimes are relevant to occupation: the “ physical fact of occupati on” engages “the common

 law principle that occupation is proof of possession in law”, and o ccupation is also informed by 
“the relationship between common law and pre-existing systems of aboriginal law”33 (meaning 
the Doctrine of Continuity). Thes e two jurisprudential sources for Aboriginal title in turn derive 
two bases for proof of it: since the sources of Ab original title are “grounded both in the common 
law and in the aboriginal perspective on land” – th e latter of which “includes, but is not limited 
to, their systems of law” – “[i]t follows that bot h should be taken into ac count in establishing the 
proof of occupancy.”34 With respect to Aboriginal laws, Chief Justice Lamer further stated:35  
As a result, if, at the time of  sovereignty, an aboriginal so ciety had laws in relation to 
land, those laws would be relevant to esta blishing the occupation of lands which are 
the subject of a claim for aboriginal title . Relevant laws might include, but are not 
limited to, a land tenure system  or laws governing land use. 
20. Like the customary law theory of Aboriginal title, the sui generis  approach has the 
important benefit of properly reco gnizing that, prior to  the arrival of Eur opeans, First Nations 
were “distinct, independent political communiti es”, with their own systems of laws that 
structured and legitimated their physical occupation of the land. The sui generis  approach 
confronts that reality both by incorporating Aboriginal laws into the proof of title, and by allowing for different First Nations to govern the in ternal use of their titl e lands differently. The 
sui generis  approach also has the advantag e, however, of ascribing uniform external  
characteristics to Aboriginal title, such that the nature of the right per se  does not differ from 
group to group: it is a communal title that cannot  be alienated except through surrender to the 
Crown,
36 and it is a right to the land itself, which th e First Nation may use in  any manner that is 
not irreconcilable with its attachment to the land.37 The sui generis  approach to the Aboriginal 
title is therefore “a blend of the diversity e nvisaged by the custom-based conception and the 
uniformity contemplated by the English-based conception.”38 
21. The sui generis  approach thereby advances th e project of r econciliation by 
acknowledging that the colonization of Canada i nvolved “the meeting of two vastly dissimilar

 legal cultures”.39 The goal is not to impose the categor ies of common law rights onto prior 
Aboriginal occupation of the land, but rather to construct “a form of intersocietal law”40 
informed by both the common law and Aboriginal pe rspectives. As Chief Justice Lamer stated in 
both Van der Peet  and Delgamuukw , “[t]rue reconciliation will,  equally, place weight on each.”41  
C. Marshall; Bernard  and the Court of Appeal 
22. Despite the strong language of Van der Peet  and Delgamuukw , in Marshall; Bernard  this 
Court strayed from the commitment to equal weight between the common law and Aboriginal 
perspectives. This departure appears unintention al; certainly the majority purported to follow 
Delgamuukw  and eschewed “imposing a European template”.42 But whereas in Delgamuukw  the 
present-day right of Aborigin al title is conceived as sui generis  – a right that cannot be 
understood by reference to either  the common law or Aboriginal legal systems alone, but only by 
reference to both – in Marshall; Bernard  it is framed as a pre- sovereignty Aboriginal practice  
that is “translated” into a modern common law  right. The act of translation engages “the 
European perspective; the nature of the right at common law must be examined to determine 
whether a particular aboriginal practice fits it.”43 As Professor Slattery notes, this translation 
approach constitutes a “sharp departure” from Delgamuukw ; under the sui generis  approach 
endorsed in that case, “aboriginal title is a distinctive inter-soci etal right that bridges the gap 
between Indigenous and European-based land systems and regulates their interaction. No 
translation is needed.”44 By conceiving of Aboriginal title as  the product of translation, the Court 
re-cast Aboriginal title in a common law mold, no matter how sensitive the translation is to the 
First Nation’s manner of life. Whereas Aboriginal  legal perspectives are given equal weight to 
the common law in the sui generis  approach, according to Marshall; Bernard  Aboriginal 
perspectives are only relevant to the Aboriginal practice , while the common law solely defines 
the right  to which the practi ce is translated.  
23. In the case at bar, the C ourt of Appeal moved further away from the Aboriginal

 customary law basis of title, and conceived of it  exclusively as the pr oduct of the common law 
test of physical occupation. While the Court of Appeal reviewed the Canadian law of Aboriginal 
title at paragraphs 174-204, nowhere in that discussion did it acknowledge Aboriginal legal 
perspectives as a source and basis of proof of the sui generis  right of Aboriginal title; only at 
paragraph 233 did the Court acknowledge that, “[i]n considering Aboriginal title and Aboriginal 
rights, the Court must ta ke into account Aborigin al perspective as well as that of the common 
law.” Moreover, while in its overview of the facts the Court quoted from the trial judge’s 
findings regarding the Tsilhqot’in’s socio-political structure – includi ng that they were “a rule 
ordered society” who “did consider  the land to be their land” and “had a concept of territory and 
boundaries”45 – the Court ultimately neglected any c onsideration of the Tsilhqot’in’s customary 
land laws in determining whether their o ccupation was sufficient to prove title.  
24. The Court of Appeal erred in law in not ta king the Tsilhqot’in’s la ws into account. While 
Tsilhqot’in members were not pres ent year-round in all parts of their territory, their laws were , as 
is underscored by the extensive evidence of th e enforcement of their exclusive rights of 
occupation. As a general proposition, if Aboriginal ti tle is properly seen as rooted in part in a 
First Nation’s socio-politic al structure, then it is plain (as was recognized in Delgamuukw ) that 
occupation of lands extends be yond physical presence; it must  also encompass the normative 
rules by which the First Nation orde red use of the land. Indeed, as will be developed more fully 
under the next heading, the relevance of customary laws to proof  of Aboriginal ti tle demonstrates 
that title is territorial  in scope, not just site specific.  
25. On appeal, this Court should view the evid ence of Tsilhqot’in oc cupation through the 
prism of Tsilhqot’in customary laws. This Court s hould also be conscious that there will be other 
cases – cases more like Delgamuukw  – where the plaintiff First Nation had a land tenure system 
more specific and prescriptive than in the case at  bar. The Court’s judgment will be applied by 
lower courts in subsequent cases and will gui de Crown-First Nation co nsultations. This Court 
should therefore make clear the continuing relevance of customary laws to Aboriginal title. 
D. Sui generis  Aboriginal title is territorial 
26. At the heart of the Court of Appeal’s judgment is a determination that Aboriginal title is 
                                            
45 See Appeal Judgment at paras 34-35, quoting from paras 356-363 and 429 of the Trial Judgment.   10 
 
 not “territorial” in extent, but ra ther applies only to particular s ites. The Court of Appeal reached 
that conclusion by focusing exclusively on the physical  occupation test from the common law, 
without considering the customary law dimension of Aboriginal title. That dimension makes 
very clear that the Court in Delgamuukw  envisioned Aboriginal title to be territorial in scope.  
27.  Chief Justice Lamer cited, as examples, “a land tenure system or laws governing land 
use” as customary laws that would be relevant to  “establishing the occupation of lands which are 
the subject of a claim for aboriginal title”.46 Later, in connection with the exclusivity 
requirement, he stated that relevant Aboriginal  laws would include “trespass laws” and “laws 
under which permission may be granted to othe r aboriginal groups to use or reside even 
temporarily on land”.47 It is inconceivable that in citing a land tenure system and trespass laws 
the Chief Justice had in mind only a patchwork of v illage sites, cultivated fields and salt licks. To 
the contrary, the Chief Justice noted that the Gitksan had tendered their adaawk  as “proof of the 
existence of a system of land tenure law inte rnal to the Gitksan, wh ich covered the whole 
territory  claimed by that appellant”, and that bot h the Gitksan and the Wet’suwet’en had 
tendered “territorial affidavits” detailing their respective houses’ “territorial holdings”;48 in each 
case, the Chief Justice observed that they would be  relevant to proof of title in a new trial.  
28. As this Court confirmed two decades ago, section 35 calls for a “just settlement for 
aboriginal peoples”.49 To fulfil that promise this  Court should return to the sui generis  basis for 
Aboriginal title set out in Delgamuukw , re-affirm the customary law dimension of Aboriginal 
title, and reject the Court of Appeal ’s restriction of title only to par ticular sites of intensive use.
