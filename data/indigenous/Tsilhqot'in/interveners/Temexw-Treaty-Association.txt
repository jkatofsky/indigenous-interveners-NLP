Certainty in the relationship between the Crown and First Nations is a central goal of treaty -
making for all parties. Modern Treaties – both those recently confirmed and those in ongoing 
negotiation – create definitions of the Nations and the people with w hom the Crown is entering 
into final agreements . These delineate those people’s rights , and they have done so broadly . In 
combination with the Indian Act, this process results in the creation of  different classes of people  
within a treaty, some of whom  do not have status, but should nonetheless have constitutional 
recognition as “Indians”.  
The definition of “Indian” for the purpose of s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 must at the 
least include all people who are recognized as part of a First Nation within a modern treaty. To 
do so is rational, coherent, and workable. T he definition of “Indian” must also become 
harmonized with the law and principles of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982  and the concept 
of an “aboriginal people” .  Doing otherwise causes  or perpetuates  the creation of arbitrarily 
defined classes of persons who are recognized as “Indians” . This  leads to uncertainty, and fails to 
advance the principle of reconciliation . This Court should recognize that our Constitution is 
intended to recognize the special status of all aboriginal people . It should not entrench the 
arbitrary divisions imposed by  the Indian Act  in the Constitution.TABLE OF CONTENTS

 PART I – FACTS  
1. The Intervener Te’mexw Treaty Association (“TTA”) accepts the facts as stated by the 
Appellants.  
2. TTA is in the process of negotiating a modern land claims agreement in the British 
Columbia Treaty Process for five First Nations located on southern Vancouver Island: Snaw -
naw-as First Nation, Songhees First Nation, T’Sou -ke Nation, Beecher Bay First Nati on, and 
Malahat Nation (the “Te’mexw Nations”). The Te’mexw Nations, surrounded by urban 
development, are seeking  to better protect their culture and exercise their rights, including the 
right to determine the membership of their communities, in order to b etter serve both status and 
non-status members.  
3. The Te’mexw Nations signed an Agreement in Principle on April 9, 2015 and are now 
entering the final stage of treaty negotiations with the negotiation of five separate Final 
Agreements.  
PART II – ISSUES  
4. The Federal Court of Appeal declined to declare that non -status Indians are “Indians” 
within the meaning of s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867  on the basis that doing so would 
lack practical utility.1 
5. The Intervener TTA advances two submissions  in rel ation to the Court of Appeal’s 
conclusion :  
a. A declaration that non -status Indians are “Indians” has a significant impact on 
negotiations in the British Columbia Treaty Process, and therefore has practical 
utility .  
b. This declaration would advance  the princi ple of reconciliation by removing 
constitutional uncertainty faced by non -status Indians.  
                                                           
1 Judgment of No ël, JA, Dawson JA, Trudel JA dated April 17, 2014, Federal Court of Appeal at paras 74 -79. 
[Appellants; Record, Vol. 1, Tab 3, p. 178]  2 
 
PART III – LAW AND ARGUMENT  
A.  There is practical utility to a  declaration that the definition of “Indians” in s. 91(24) 
includes n on-status Indians.   
Overview  
6. The parties to  modern treaty negotiations recognize  that it is not satisfactory to restrict the 
definition of a First Nation to exclusively those persons with status under the Indian Act , when 
what is at stake is the settlement of past claims, the establishmen t of modern governance 
regimes, the regularization of inter -governmental relations , the definition of modern treaty rights, 
the adjustment or recognition of historic aboriginal and treaty rights,  and the institution of a 
reliable, certain and stable legal framework.  
7. In this context , the Crown and First Nations have recognized that it is necessary to define 
the pre -existing , historical  First Nation and to exte nd “eligibility ” for inclusion in the modern 
post-treaty  First Nation beyond the narrowly and arbit rarily defined group of persons with Indian 
Act status . Instead  these treaty partners have  found  that a proper approach to recognizing First 
Nations should be more expansive and take  into account aboriginal ancestry, self -identification 
and cultural attachment to a community  of indigenous people .   
8. TTA  submits that a consistent  approach should be taken in  defining the ambit of s. 
91(24 ). A single constit utional definition of “Indians” , as a definition for  indigenous or 
aborig inal peoples  in Canada,  should be informed  by ancestry and connection, rather than by an 
arbitrary blood quantum.  This will ensure  that there is a logical alignment between the Federal 
government’s jurisdiction ove r “Indians” and the modern understanding of wh at constitutes a 
“First Nation”, as well as consistency between different aspects of our Constitution.  
9. This approach has utility in the treaty relationship and is required in order to advance  
reconciliation  between the Crown and aboriginal peoples . The C ourt should reject the idea that 
our Constitution has the same approach toward Indians as does the Indian Act,  which, by 
unilaterally labelling some “Indians” and some not, aims to effect assimilation and has bee n used 
to the detriment  and stigmatization  of aboriginal people.  3 
 
The modern treaty process seeks certainty and defines First Nation collectivities  
10. A treaty is a solemn agreement , constitutional ly recognized, that delineates the 
relationship between the Federal and Provincial Crowns and a First Nation  and seeks to create 
certainty in that relationship .2 A treaty will describe who constitutes a First Nation and thereby 
determines who holds the right to extinguish , modify or render non -assertable pre -existi ng 
aboriginal and treaty rights, and who is eligible to have a say in ratifying the modern treaty and 
to enjoy the rights provided in it.  
11. As a treaty defines the people whose rights will be affected in the agreement, two central 
questions in modern land c laims negotiations are: (1) who constitutes the “First Nation” with 
whom the Crown is negotiating a treaty; and (2) what will the relationship be tween the First 
Nation and the F ederal government be after the new treaty comes into effect.  
12. Modern treaties have set out broad definitions of who constitutes a First Nation . These do 
not limit inclusion in the First Nation to persons who have status under the Indian Act . In the 
Nisga’a Final Agreement, the “Nisga’a Nation” is defined to mean “the collectivity of those 
aboriginal p eople  who share the language, culture and laws of the Nisga’a Indians  of the Nass 
Area, and their descendants”.3 This group ’s rights are defined for the purpose of modifying their 
existing aboriginal rights and title with the coming into effect of the treaty.  The Maa -nulth Final 
Agreement  defines who constitutes each o f the Maa -nulth collectivities  broadly so as to 
encompass anyone of Maa -nulth ancestry or who has been adopted into the Maa -nulth, and any 
of their descendants.4 The Yale First Nation Final A greement  (which is in the process of being 
ratified)  takes  an in termediate approach: every present member of the Yale Band is included 
together with anyone of Yale ancestry who has a “demonstrated attachment” to the Yale  First

Nation, toge ther with the descendants of these groups and certain persons who are adopted into 
the Nations.5 
13. None of the definitions  contained in these agreements  describes  membership in  a First 
Nation as being limited to person s with status  under the Indian Act . Canada’s Comprehensive 
Claims  Policy discloses that the Crown is engaged in treaty negotiation with “Aboriginal 
peoples”  (“descendants of the original inhabitants of North America”) , or “Aboriginal groups” 
and that the definition of beneficiaries under final agreements will not affect the status of persons 
under the Indian Act .6 
14. Given the effects of statutory enfranchisement imposed over the history of the Indian Act , 
it is very likely that  under these broad definitions  there  are large groups of people who are part of 
a “Nation”  recognized by a treaty  but who do not have status .7 With the second -generation cut -
off rule , which, over time , results in  reducing  the number  of persons  eligible for status , this group 
of non -status persons who are part of a First Nation under a treaty will continue to grow .8  
15. Declaring that non -status aboriginal people are “Indians” for the purpose of s. 91(24) has 
utility and significant effect, and creates a more rational  and consistent statutory and 
constitutional framework for governance in the area.  
A coherent policy approach has utility 
16. The TTA submits that for modern treaties, statutory frameworks and constitu tional law to 
be coherent, the C ourt should recognize that federal jurisdiction over “Indians, and lands 
reserved to the Indians” must extend at least to those people who fit within the definition of a 
First Nation in a modern treaty, regardless of their Indian Act  status. This is required in order to 
address the question of whether the Federal or Provincial government has legislative jurisdiction 
over the entirety of the collectivity making up a First Nation , irrespective of whether those 
people have Indian Act status or not.

17. The approach taken by the Court of Appeal, in declining  to recognize  non-status Indians  
as included under  s. 91(24) , permits  an incoherent and illogical framewor k for the definition of 
“Indian ” to persist.  A declaration that non -status Indians have constitutional status within s. 
91(24) has utility, as it resolves  a situation where there are multiple categories of “ Indian ”, all of 
which  should have constitutional recognition.  
Modern  treaties create d ifferent categories of “Indians”  
18. The people who co nstitute a “First Nation”  in the context of treaty negotiation  are those 
people who have the right to enter into a treaty by voting on it, thereby confirming th e agreement 
with the Crown delineating the rights and obligations of the Nations.  Before a treaty  is 
completed, this collectivity will include the people eligible to be enrolled under the final 
agreement (such as band members, people who identify  with the community, those with a 
substantial connection,  and their  descendants).  
19. Following a complet ed treaty, a First Nation creates a constitution, which will determine  
citizenship in the nation. The group of defined Citizens of a First Nation may be even broader 
than those eligible to be enrolled , and expanded to include persons who were not initially  part of 
the First Nation prior to treaty. As with membership in an Indian Band, neither being part of a 
First Nation nor having citizenship with that First Nation will necessarily be tied to having status 
under the Indian Act . In each of the Nisga’a, Maa -nulth and Yale Agreements there is an explicit 
statement that eligibility does not confer the right to be registered as a status Indian or enjoy any 
of the rights or benefits of being a status Indian .9  
20. Despite the oft -stated goal of putting the provisions of the Indian Act  into the past, 
modern treaties expressly continue the application of the status provisions of the Indian Act . For 
example, transitional provisions concerning tax exemption s extend only to “Indians” an d not 
eligible persons .10

21. The modern Final Agreement framework also notes that programs may be available for 
“regist ered Indians or other Indians,”  which recognizes that the scope of “ registered Indians” 
under the Indian Act  may not be co -extensive with “ Indians” for other purposes.11  
The e ffects of incoherence and the creation of categories  of Indians  are significant   
22. Where F ederal responsibility over non -status I ndians is not recognized in the  manner  
submitted , the legal framework creates multiple and increasingly confusing categories over time.  
The existence of a distinction between people who have status under the Indian Act  and the 
persons who are part of the collective comprising a First Nation in a treaty context  has the 
potential to  arise  in a number of ways , affecting  all parties to a treaty .   
23. In the treaty -making context, o ne consequence  of the denial of F ederal responsibilit y over 
non-status Indians  is that the overall size of the treaty package is determined by reference to the 
number  of status Indians. Federal program fundin g is limited to status Indians.12 This means that 
the number of status versu s non -status Indians determines the total size of the funding available 
to operate the governments and programs that will be administered f ollowing treaties  for all of 
the First Nation’s citizens . Despite recognition of self -government, treaty -making nations may be 
forced to limit availability of programs to their members  because of F ederal refusal to recognize 
and support non -status persons enrolled as part  of those nations.  
24. While a concluded treaty would appear to provide certainty, given that Federal and 
Provincial priorities can shift over time , the existence of multiple definitions of “Indians” gives 
rise to the potential for statutory gaps to exist . The F ederal government may wish to fill these 
statutory gaps, but  with uncertainty around the jurisdictional reach of s. 91(24) , it may be limited 
in its ability to do so . The Federal government  may also wish to develop national policies re lated 
to treaty implementation . These will be thwarted if they do not  extend to all persons caught by a 
treaty.  If there is a change in Provincial policy, this could also create a legislative gap.

25. These gaps have  the potential to have a detrimental effect on non -status  people eligible 
for enrollment as part of a treaty nation , as they may not benefit from a F ederal policy  that is 
implemented  or may be limited in their enjoyment of treaty benefits . 
26. As noted in the Trial Judgment, the jurisdictional avoidance of non -status Indians  has 
resulted in the failure of governments to supply services, and has led to non -status Indians facing 
higher levels of discrimination and social disadvantage.13 The law should not operate to create 
this collection of inconsistent categories with significant potential to cause and contribute to  
prejudice , especially when an alternative approach is readily available and workable . 
The approach proposed  by TTA  is workable and rational  
27. Inclusion  of all persons eligible for enrollment  in the First Nations with whom Canada is 
or will be in a treaty relationship is a reasonable and workable approach  to the scope of the 
definition “Indian” under s. 91(24) . 
This approach creates  consistency  within the Constitution  
28. The Constitution, as our supreme law, should provide certainty by having  internal 
consistency. The approach  proposed by TTA  will tend to better align the category of persons 
subject to s. 91(24)  of the Constitution Act, 1867  (“Indi ans”) with the group of persons described 
in s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (“aboriginal”) . This  would include  modern land  claims 
agreements as well as historic treaties.  This alignment will  simplify constitutional categories in a 
way that leads to le ss confusion and diminishes the  potential for gaps where there  are persons 
who may not be cle arly covered by the exercise of  either Provincial or Federal jur isdiction.  
This approach is more closely aligned with goals of treaty -making including self -defini tion 
29. Expanding s. 91(24) to include all those  eligible for enrollment  in First Nations who are 
treaty signatories  will further advance the goal of allowing First Nations to articulate who they 
are. This is a priority for treaty -making nations and is required in order to make advancements 
toward reconciliation. The definition of “Indians” and who has jurisdiction and bears legislative 
                                                           
13 Decision of Phelan J. dated January 8, 2013 at paras 84-89. [Appellants’ Record Vol. 1, Tab 1, p. 1]  8 
 
responsibility for that group of people must take a turn toward sel f-definition, and away from 
statutory imposition of identity and illegitimate aims of assimilation.14  
30. Doing so will ensure that treaties address the needs of aboriginal people embarking on 
final agreements in a manner that is consistent with  Canada’s const itutional framework . It also 
permits the parties to treaties to finally “[speak] the same language when they sit around the 
negotiating table to discuss self -government and constitutional issues.”15 
A broader  approach is already  used in the treaty context  
31. There are well -developed approaches to defining the scope of the eligible collectivity of 
First Nations in a ma nner that is not confined to  status under the Indian Act with reference to 
general concepts such as ancestry or indigenous cultural concepts such as matrilineal 
connection16 or cultural connection .17 This demonstrates that doing so does not lead to an 
unmanageable and indefinite definition.  Instead , such a definition is possible and practical, and 
properly requires being sensitive to the existence of a larger aboriginal nation than may be 
identified by reference to status.   
There is no countervailing federalism principle  
32. The expanded scope of F ederal legislative competence proposed is not outweighed by a 
countervailing federalism concern. This approac h to s. 91(24) is consistent with the modern view 
of the division of powers as an enabling federal mechanism. As stated in Tsilhqot’in , the purpose 
of interjuridictional immunity  is is to ensure that the two levels of government are able to operate 
without  interference in their core areas of exclusive jurisdiction. As there, that goal is not 
implicated here  by the broader approach submitted .18  
33. Historically one of the concerns about an overly broad description of s.91(24) jurisdiction 
was the potential unpre dictable effects of the application of interjurisdictional immunity. The 
concern that traditionally existe d was that an overly expansive F ederal power could lead to 
unforeseen g aps due to its displacement of P rovincia l legislative power. The  approach advan ced

by TTA instead h as the benefit of enabling the F ederal government to establish policies and fill 
gaps without countervailing fea r that this will conflict with P rovincial legislative regimes. Here 
there is a good policy reason to take an expansive view,  which is required under s. 91(24).  
34. In the modern context, this Court, beginning with Canadian Western Bank19 and 
Lafarge20 and most recently with Tsilhqot’in21 and Grassy Narrows22 has substantially limited 
the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity, especi ally with respect to matters such as lands, 
resources, property and civil rights in the provinces. As such, there is little to no risk that 
adopting a broader view of the F ederal legislative jurisdiction will crea te unforeseen gaps in 
Provincial legislativ e authority or P rovincial regulatory regimes.  
B. A declaration that non-status Indians are included in the definition under s. 91(24) 
advances the principle of reconciliation  
35. Modern treaties are tripartite agreements where all three parties pledge themsel ves to 
ensure that  the treaties are implemented in accordance with their terms and the honour of the 
Crown. The goal of reconciliation is furthered where both levels of non -indigenous government 
have the ability to ensure that the commitments made in the t reaty are implemented, in particular 
to the benefit of all of those peoples whose rights have been adjusted, modified or affected by the 
modern treaty. In this way, the Crown (represented by both governments)  is enabled to act 
without forcing First Nations  to have recourse to the courts or dispute resolution in the event that 
one level of government fails to properly implement the treaty.  
36. The approach proposed by the TTA also advances the goal of reconciliation by giving 
more comprehensive recognition to aboriginal people without focusing on the arbitrary and 
historically discriminatory definition of status  adopted in the Indian Act . Doing so  would shift 
the emphasis in understanding of what it means to be an “Indian” away from the narrow statutory 
definition focused exclusively on blood quantum , toward the concept of aboriginality reflected in 
s. 35 (1), which is sensitive to ancestral connection, current connection to the community, self 
identification and culture.23
