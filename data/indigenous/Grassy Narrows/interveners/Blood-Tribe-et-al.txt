PART I – OVERVIEW and STATEMENT OF FACTS  
1. The federal government has a Constitutional  obligation to implement and protect Treaty 
rights . The harvesting right  in the numbered Treaties is no exception.   
2. Where the province takes up la nd that causes a meaningful diminution of the continued 
exercise of Treaty rights , the federal government , as a signatory to th ese Treaty promises, is 
constitutionally obliged to intervene to protect those rights.   
3. The situation in Alberta foreshadows what may  occur in Treaty 3 if sufficient safeguards 
are not put in place , in advance of intensive resource development, to ensure the Treaty  
harvesting promise.  In regions  faced with ongoing  and intensive resource  development, 
particularly where the province stands to benefit financially from a proposed taking up (through 
royalties for example), t he duty to consult  and accommodate, in the experience of the Intervener 
Nations, is not sufficient to protect their Treaty harvesting rights.  
4. The plain language of the harvesting clauses in Treaties 3 - 7, s. 91(24) , the promise of s.35  
and the honour of Crown, demand the federal  government , as a Treaty signatory,  step-in to 
ensure the Treaty pr omise is not eviscerated by provincial Cr own actions in relation to  public 
lands .   
 
PART II – STATEMENT OF ISSUES 
5. The Blood Tribe, Siksika Nation, Beaver Lake Cree Nation, Ermineskin Cree Nation and 
Whitefish Lake First Nation #128 (collectively, "Interve ner Nations"), wish  to make the 
following  points : 
a. In certain circumstances, where the province takes up lands  pursuant to their 
jurisdiction over public lands and resources , the dut y to consult and accommodate 
may be insufficient to protect Treaty harvesting rights; 
b. The Government of Canada has a positive obligation  to protect Treaty rights, and 
the harvesting right in the numbered Treaties is no exception;  and 
c. The Government of Canada's involvement in protecting Treaty rights would not 
present a co mpletely  new paradigm. Fears expressed by the Respondents and the  2 
Ontario Court of Appeal about the "evisce ration" of the province's jurisdiction 
over public lands  are vastly overstated .   
 
PART III – STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT  
 
A. In some  circumstances , the duty to c onsult may  not sufficiently protect Treaty rights  
6. The situation in Alberta foreshadows what may occur in Treaty 3 if sufficient protections 
are not in place to ensure the Treaty harvesting promise.  
7. The Blood Tribe1 and Sikisika Nation2 are parties to Treaty 7.  Beaver Lake Cree Nation3, 
Ermineskin Cree Nation4, and Whitefish Lake First Nation #1285 are Treaty 6 beneficiar ies. 
Most of the lands in Treaties  6 and 7, and in the traditional territories of these Nations, have 
already been taken up by agricu lture, oil and gas, forestry and other developments.  Remaining 
lands suitable for the exercise of Treaty rights are rapidly being taken up for oil sands 
development, coal mines,  forestry  and grazing leases.  
8. The Intervener First Nations submit that when a  provincial Crown discharges  the dual 
roles of :  a) taking -up land for resource extraction projects to generate provincial revenue, 
through royalties for example; and b) consult ing about impacts of those projects on Treaty rights , 
                                                 
1 The Blood Tribe, also known as the Kainai, are comprised mainly of Niitsitapi  (Blackfoot) speaking people.  There 
are approximately 11,820 Blood Tribe members.  Their reserve lands are located approximately 200 km south of 
Calgary, Alberta near the city of Lethbridge, Alberta and include a timber reserve (IR 148 and IR 148A).  
 
2 The Siksika Nation is comprised of mainly Niitsitapi (Blackfoot) speaking people.  The reserve lands of the 
Siksika Nation are located approximately 100 km east of Calgary, Alberta (IR 146).  The current membership of the 
Siksika Nation is approximately 6988 people.  
 
3 Beaver Lake Cree Nation is comprised of mainly Nehiyaw (Cree) speaking people, with approximately 1092 
members.  The nation's reserve lands are located approximately 17 km southeast of Lac La Biche, Alberta (IR 131).  
 
4. Ermineskin Cree Nation' s reserve lands are lo cated in two separate locations, approximately 70 km south of 
Edmonton, Alberta (IR 138 and IR 138A) near their traditional territory of Bear Hills and Pigeon Lake.  There are currently about 4 ,377 members of the N ation.   
 
5 The reser ve lands of Whitefish Lake First Nation #128 are located approximately 200 km northeast of Edmonton, 
Alberta (IR 128).  The current membership of the Nation of approximately 2,378 people, are the descendants of the 
Whitefish Lake Cree  
  3 
there can be instances wh en the protection of Treaty rights is not at forefront of the reconciliation 
exercise.  
9. The duty to consult and , if indicated, accommodate, as interpreted and implemented by the 
Alberta Crown, threatens the continued existence of Treaty harvesti ng rights, particularly in parts  
of the province facing intensive  resource development. The shortcomings of the consultation 
process for provincial ly regulated resource development s are thoroughly reviewed in a paper 
recently published by the Canadian Institute of Re sources Law by David Laidlaw and Monique 
Passelac- Ross.6 
10. The Alberta Crown disregard s "the critical importance of  consultation on strategic 
decision -making and on cumulative impacts management, preferring to focus on project -specific 
consultation" .7 While taking -up land for an individual project  may not result in significant 
impacts, hundreds of individually insignificant projects , taken together , can render large swaths 
of traditional territory unsuitable for the  exercise of Treaty rights.8 
11. First Nations should not have to wait until no meaningful ability to hunt, fish and trap, 
exists to commence an  infringement action.  
12. Consultation processes depend on good- faith efforts to share information and, if done 
meaningfully , lead to the negotiation  of measures to mitigate impacts on Treaty rights.  Despite 
the protection of s.35 and what the common law mandates, in the context of rapid and intensive  
natural resource development on provincial Crown land, First Nations are seriously 
disadva ntaged in these negotiations.  First, the Crown and industry generally come to the table 
with significantly more financial and technical resources than  First Nations. While First Nations 
have superior knowledge regarding their  members'  use of the provincial  Crown lands to be 
impacted, they generally do not have the scientific and technical expertise that the Crown and

industry have on hand.9  Second, this resourcing deficit is exacerbated by the sheer volume o f 
project applications proposed within First Nati ons' traditional territories  and the short timelines 
to respond.10  Thir d, an analysis of the cumulative impact of numerous projects on a Nation's 
harvesting rights is largely absent from the project -specific approach to consultation favoured by 
Alberta.11 
13. In Alberta, t he administrative tribunals that oversee the regulation of resource projects 
under provincial jurisdiction have, to date, been reluctant to consider whether a project approval 
(which would lead to lands being taken- up) would adversely affect Tr eaty rights.12  Recent 
changes to the legislative regime governing energy projects  in fact  remove d the tribunal's 
jurisdiction to assess the adequacy of Crown consultation.13   
14. While recourse to the courts remains an option, forcing First Nations to commence 
litigation to challenge the decision s of provincial regulator s is less than ideal for all involved. 
First, court challenges of this type are " expensive, extensive and complicated " for both First 
Nations and project propone nts whose projects can be tied up for years.  Second, the usual 
remedy is for the court "to direct the affected First Nation to engage in additional consultation 
with the same parties that misunderstood their concerns the first time ."14 
15. The Intervener Natio ns make these points  not to add to the record of this appeal or to ask 
this Court to make factual findings about acti vities occurring in Alberta.  We make these points  
to provide the Court with a First Nation perspective of what can happen,  on the ground, when 
intensive  provincially regulated development conflicts with the ongoing exercise of Treaty

ABAER 14, 2013CarswellAlta 1393, where the Alberta Energy Regulator held that it would not consider 
constitutional questions raised by the  intervener First Nation (at paras 22 -32), that its focus was on the "project -level 
effects", and it would not consider cumulative effects (at paras 112 and 163- 174), Tab 1; Teck Resources Ltd ., 2013

harvesting rights , and to demonstrate the practical shortcomings of the duty to consult in this 
context , when led by the provincial Crown.  
16. The protection of  Treaty harvesting rights promised by the duty to consult and 
accommodate has been largely illusory.  We are not aware of any decision in th e last quarter -
century made by an Alberta tribunal in the context of a resource project application that require d 
the taking up of lands  that has concluded the pr otection of Treaty rights trumped the economic 
benefits of the project.  As this Court noted in Haida, when balancing Aboriginal interests with 
the public interest, the scales tend to tip "in favour of protecting  jobs and government revenue, 
with the result that Aboriginal interests tend to 'lose'"15. 
B. The Federal Crown has a positive duty to protect Treaty rights  
17. The Intervener Nations submit that the federal Crown has a positive  obligation to protect 
First Nations  against any provincial decision or decisions which collectively result in anything 
more than an insignificant interferenc e with Treaty harvesting rights, including  decisions that 
result in the taking up of lands necessary for projects under provincial jur isdiction.  
18. First, the plain language in the harvesting clauses of  Treaties 3 to 7 contemplate the taking 
up of lands by the federal government , not the province . 
19. Second, Treaty harvesting rights fall squarely within federal jurisdiction under s.91(24) .16 
Any exercise of discretion by a province under s.92 of the Constitution Act  that causes more than 
an insignificant interference with Treaty harvesting rights will be ultra vires .17 A Treaty promise 
to guarantee hunting, fishing and trapping  represents a positive source of protection against 
infringements  by the province.18

18 Simon v. The Queen , [1985] 2 SCR 387, at para. 26 , Tab 6 .

20. Third, a solemn constitutional obligation to First Nations aimed at reconciling their 
Aboriginal interests with Crown sovereignty engages  the honour of the Crown.19 
21. Taken together, the pl ain language of the Treaty, s.91(24) and the honour of the Crown 
require  the federal government to act with diligence  in ensuring the protection of Treaty 
harvesting rights . 
22. We acknowledge the Government of Canada has, to date, largely failed to take any a ctive 
role to protect Treaty harvesting rights.20  Canada' s past omission s ought not relieve it  of its 
Constitutional obligation s going forward. It would be inequitable, and we submit, contrary to the 
purpose of s.35 and the honour of the Crown, to re ly on past failures to  fulfill and protect Treaty 
rights to justify ongoing failures . Such an approach could act as a dis incentive  to fulfilling Treaty 
promises  until a Court mandates otherwise .  This would undermine, not promote , reconciliation.  
C. Involvement of Federal Crown not a Radical Paradigm Shift  
23. Fears expressed by the Respondents and the Ontario Court of Appeal about the 
"evisceration " of the province's legislative competence under s.92 and s.109 over public lands 
are vastly overstated.21 
24. Contrary to the assertions of the Respondents, involving the federal Crown to ensure the 
protection of Treaty harvesting rights does not represent a radical paradigm shift.  
25. The proactive protection of Aboriginal interests and Treaty rights  is not without precedent. 
The federal government in the United States has on several occasions  commenced litigation to 
protect Native American interests and Treaty rights.22 
                                                 
19 Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada, 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 SCR 623, at para. 9 , Tab 4. 
 
20 For example, Specific Claims Tribunal Act, S.C. 2008, c. 22, s.15(1)(g) : 
15. (1) A First Nation may not file with the Tribunal a claim that  
… 
(g) is based on treaty rights related to activities of an ongoing and variable nature, such as 
harvesting rights.

Tab 3.  
 
22 See: Winters v. United States , 207 U.S. 564 ,28 S. Ct. 207, 52 L. Ed. 340, 1908 U.S. LEXIS 1415, Tab 10;  United 
  7 
26. Moreover, pursuant to its jurisdiction under s.91(24), the Government of Canada  is 
already i ntegrated into several areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as health and social 
services.23 Likewise, under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act , 201224 and the 
previous version of the act25, federal regulators work and continue to work jointly with 
provincial regulators to review proposed projects that fall under provincial and federal 
jurisdiction.26 
27. It would not be a significant burden on the federal Crown to take steps to actively ensure 
that its Treaty promises are being fulfilled and respected by provincial governments. This 
burden, given the Treaties and the honour of the Crown, should not fall solely on the shoulders 
of First Nations.  
28. Statements by the Respondent  Goldcorp Inc.27 that all existing  provi ncial permits and land 
tenures are in jeopardy , lack any legal foundation.   
29. Finally, t he Respondent s cite the need for "certainty" as a basis to reject  federal 
involvement in the taking up of provincial public lands.  "Certainty" cannot be judged solely by 
the perspective of industry and the Crown.  The Intervener Nations also seek certainty – the 
certainty that their members ' and their decedents ' cultur e and way of life will survive based on 
the continued opportunity to exercise harvesting rights as  promised in the Treaty.
