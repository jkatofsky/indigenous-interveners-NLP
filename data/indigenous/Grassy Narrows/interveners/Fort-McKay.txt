Factum  of the Intervener Fort McKay   Overview and Statement of Facts  
   
 
FACTUM OF THE INTERVENER  
FORT MCKAY FIRST NATION 
 
 
PART I – OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS  
  
1. Fort McKay First Nation [Fort McKay] intervenes in this appeal to defend constitutional 
protections applicable to its Treaty 8 rights, as modified by the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement  
[NRTA ] (Book of Authorities of the Intervener Fort McKay First nation, hereinafter BAIFM, Tab 31)  
with Alberta (schedule 2 to the Constitution Act, 1930, BAIFM, Tab 29).  Treaty 8 rights, as modified  
(BAIFM, Tab 33) , enjoy constitutional protection through the whole of the Constitution Act, 1930, the 
Constitution Act, 1982 (BAIFM, Tab 30) , and the Honour of the Crown. The factual context of the 
present appeal does not involve consideration of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreements  [NRTAs ] 
under the Constitution Act, 1930,
1 yet the parties and the Courts below make comments on matters of 
law applicable to Numbered Treaties which have significance far beyond the Treaty 3 areas of  Ontario.  
McKay therefore makes subm issions respecting the significance of Treaty 8 and the NRTAs to the legal 
issues before the Court. 
----------  
PART II – STATEMENT OF ISSUES  
  
2. Fort McKay does not take a position on the primary issue before this Court, described by the 
Ontario Court of Appeal as whether Ontario has the right to "take up" lands and thereby limit 
harvesting rights without first obtaining Canada's approval in the Treaty 3 lands. 
3. Fort McKay takes a position on two points:  first, via Treaty 8 negotiation and the NRTA 
(BAIFM, Tabs 33 and 31) , solemn assurances of continuity have been repeatedly given to Treaty 
Indians; second, there are legal consequence of such assurances for the exercise of provincial powers 
over land and resources, the taking up of land, and the duty to consult.  
----------  
                                            
1  Reasons for Decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, paragraph 233: “We do not propose to comment 
on the NRTA since it is unnecessary for the resolution of these appeals.”  - 2 - 
 
Factum  of the Intervener Fort McKay   Statement of Argument  
   
 
PART III – STATEMENT OF ARGUMENT 
 
 
4. The historical developments giving rise to constitutional protections for Treaty 8 are 
summarized in earlier jurisprudence of this Court, cited herein, in Kent McNeil’s article Indian 
Hunting, Trapping and Fishing Rights in the Prairie Provinces of Canada, and in the late Gerard V. 
La Forest’s book Natural Resources and Public Property under the Canadian Constitution.2 
In summary, by the Rupert’s Land and North- Western Territory Order,3 Canada’s acquisition of 
Rupert’s Land involved both (i) the assurance t hat “upon the transference of the territories in question 
to the Canadian Government, the claims of the Indian tribes to compensation for lands required for 
purposes of settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equitable principles w hich 
have uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the aborigines”4 and also (ii) the 
obligation that “[a]ny claims of Indians to compensation for lands required for purposes of settlement 
shall be disposed of by the Canadian Government in communication with the Imperial Government; 
and the Company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect of them.”5 
5. Canada and First Nations then negotiated the Numbered Treaties.  This Court already recognizes 
that, since the lands comprising Treaty  8 were largely unsuitable for agriculture, “[t]he Commissioners 
who negotiated Treaty 8 could therefore express confidence to the First Nations that, as previously 
mentioned, ‘the same means of earning a livelihood would continue after the treaty as exist ed before 
it’.”6 At the time of the Treaty and subsequent Adhesions, and until 1930, the Treaty 8 assurances 
included continuity of the ability to hunt, fish and trap for commercial purposes.7 With respect to 
mining in the Treaty 8 area, in particular, this Court also recognizes that “[a] lthough it was expected that 
some white prospectors might stake claims in the north, this was not expected to have an impact on the 
Indians'  hunting rights.”8 These collateral promises are integral to Treaty 8 interpreta tion, because the 
written version of the exchange of promises documented in Treaty 8 does not constitute an accurate

record of all the rights of the Aboriginal  party and all the duties of the Crown that were created in that 
exchange.9  
6. Canada retained admi nistration and control of Crown lands when the provinces of Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and Alberta were created; and it assumed this responsibility in the Railway Belt and 
Peace River Block of British Columbia.10 In 1930, through the Schedules in the Constitution Act, 193 0, 
these Provinces assumed administration and control over these Crown lands. By section 1 of the 
Constitution Act, 1930, however, provincial jurisdiction over lands and resources was expressly made 
subject to existing trusts or other interests,  and was further limited by the NRTA provisions applicable 
to each Province.   
7. With respect to Trusts or other interests, the Courts below agree that Ontario's rights in public 
lands under s. 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867, are subject to the harvesting rights under Treaty 3.11 
Ontario concedes this, stating that its property in lands, mines, minerals and resources pursuant to the Constitution Act, 1867, is subject to “treaty harvesting rights” because such rights are within the proviso respecting the ownership of public lands.
12 It necessarily follows that its s . 91 rights are subject 
to these same Treaty rights.  This proviso in the Constitution Act, 1867, is underlined in the chart in Part 
VII. Identical wording appears in cl ause 1 of each of the provincial Schedules to the Constitution Act, 
1930, also underlined in Part VII. The intent of the Constitution Act, 1930, was to put the provinces in 
the same position as Ontario (and the other original Provinces of Confederation). T he rights of Ontario 
as regards Crown lands and resources were subject to Treaty rights. When administration and control of 
Crown lands and resources was transferred to the provinces of Alberta through the Constitution Act, 
1930, Alberta also took that int erest subject to Treaty rights as amended by the NRTAs.  
8. The intent of the NRTAs  was to secure substantive Indian harvesting rights, also described by 
this Court as a substantive livelihood right.13 For Treaty 8, this involves a continuing ability to hunt,  
fish and trap for subsistence and cultural purposes, and to be able to pass that Aboriginal tradition onto

future generations.14 This is a fundamental element of the constitutional assurances given to First 
Nations so as to obtain their consent or adhesion  to Treaty 8, and also a fundamental element of the 
constitutional assurances given to First Nations in 1930. The division of powers was amended by the 
Constitution Act, 1930, to ensure that this substantive livelihood right would be respected by the 
Provi nces, and by Canada.  Alberta is obligated to carry out this arrangement by clause 2 of the NRTA 
and/or the Honour of the Crown. 
9. With respect to specific provisions of the NRTAs , paragraph 9 of the NRTA with Alberta 
provides that the rights to fishery were to belong and be administered by the Province “[e] xcept as 
herein otherwise provided.”  Since the transfer of public lands generally was subject to Treaty rights, 
the provincial rights in relation to fishery are also subject to Treaty 8 rights to fish. Paragraph 12 of the 
NRTA with Alberta has two assurances. It provides that provincial laws respecting game were to be 
applicable to Indians “in order to secure to the Indians of the Province the continuance of the supply of 
game and fish for their support and subsistence.”15 This is a substantive right to the continuance of the 
supply of game. Alberta also “assures” to the Indians the right to hunt for food on “all unoccupied 
Crown lands and on any other lands to which the Indians have a right of access.”  This i ncludes Indian 
reserve lands.16 This is a substantive right to hunt for food. The right to a supply of game and fish for 
support and subsistence, and the right to hunt for food, are both subst antive rights under Treaty 8 
as modified by the NRTAs . 
10. This Court  states that the Indians were again re- assured of their continuing right to hunt and fish 
for food when the Treaty rights were “merged and consolidated” by the NRTAs . Dickson J., in Frank , 
stated that  while the NRTA  had partially amended the scope of the Treaty hunting right, " of equal 
importance  was the desire to re- state and reassure to the treaty Indians the continued enjoyment of the right 
to hunt and fish for food" (emphasis added).17  
11. There is no question that t he NRTA limits provincial competence in respect of Indian livelihood 
rights under Treaty 8. Peter Hogg’s text,  Constitutional Law of Canada, identifies the NRTA as one of 
the “exceptions to the general rule that provincial laws apply to Indians and lands r eserved for

Indians.”18 He describes the NRTA as “[a] further limitation on provincial competence to make laws 
applicable to Indians”19 and confirms that, subject to games laws intended to protect the supply of 
game, “provincial laws cannot affect treaty rig hts.”20 Hogg also states that the NRTA is “a right of the 
Indians to take game and fish for food” and that “provincial laws cannot deprive Indians of this 
right.”21 The submission of the Respondent Goldcorp, which is that provincial laws may burden Indian 
harvesting rights because such laws apply to First Nations “ ex proprio vigore  or by incorporation under 
s. 88 of the Indian Act ”22 is mistaken in the context of Treaty 8.  Paragraph  12 of the NRTA  does not 
confer capacity upon the Province of Alberta to impose broad provincial regulation of Treaty harvesting for purposes unrelated to conservation of game necessary for the continued enjoyment of Indian livelihood 
rights.
23  
12. Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence confirms these propositions. In Horseman,  
Wilson  J. (in the minority, but with the majority on this point) considers the effect of the NRTA upon 
Treaty 8 and states that the NRTA modified the Treaty 8 rights through a quid pro quo. The ability to 
pursue a commercial livelihood from hunting, fishing and trapping was unilaterally extinguished, but this involved a limitation on provincial powers:  “[b]oth the area of hunting and the way in which the 
hunting could be conducted was removed from the jurisdiction of provincial governments.”
24 
This Court confirms in Badger  that this fundamental change to the nature of the Treaty right, in exchange 
for a limitation in provincial power, was unilaterally imposed by the Federal Crown, and that “[i]t is unlikely that it would proceed in that manner today.”
25 It follows necessaril y that the law of 
inter-jurisdictional immunity is embedded in the NRTA, such that  its abolition would constitute a 
constitutional amendment without consultation with Fort McKay or other First Nations.  
13. In Gladstone  the Court states that paragraph 12 of the  NRTA  “provides for a permanent 
settlement of the legal rights of the aboriginal groups to whom it applies.”26 Blais (which involved 
hunting, and not trapping or fishing) describes the purpose of the NRTA as being “to ensure respect for

the Crown’s obligati ons to ‘Indians’ with respect to hunting rights.”27 With respect to the substantive 
right to a supply of game and fish, the Court in Sutherland adopts the  reasons of McGillivray J.A. 
in R. v. Wesley for the proposition that the intention of paragraph 12 of the NRTA “is to assure to the 
Indians a supply of game in the future for their support and subsistence … subject to the express and 
dominant proviso that care for the future is not to deprive them of the right to satisfy their present need for food by hunt ing…”.
28  
14. Treaty 8 rights include hunting, fishing and trapping, and are far more than privileges of 
hunting, fishing or trapping somewhere. Treaty 8 negotiations and the NRTA both involve solemn 
assurances of continuity of practices, traditions and customs  integral to First Nation societies.  In this 
respect, l ocation is important to First Nations -- particularly in areas in which the traditions were 
undertaken by ancestors, and on or near Indian reserves. This Court recognizes this reality in 
Mikisew  Cree, where Binnie J. for the Court writes that “ for aboriginal people, as for non- aboriginal 
people, location is important.”29  
15. The Indian livelihood right has not received sufficient legal recognition. McNeil states that 
NRTA assurances “have been used as an aid in interpreting the game laws paragraph, but they have not 
been given legal significance in themselves.”30 Treaty 8 embodies a solemn engagement to Indians that 
their livelihood would be respected,31 and the NRTA  restates this obligation.32 Fort McKay submits that, 
in the tradition of the common law anticipated by this Court’s judgment in Haida,33 it is now time that 
the solemn constitutional assurances respecting continuity be given greater legal significance of 
themselves.  
16. The need for greater recognition arises from the acute sensitivity associated with provincial 
powers in respect of land and resources. Constitutionally protected T reaty 8 rights are, today,

both substantive and procedural in nature.34 This should require a nuanced, contextual approach to the 
interplay between Treaty 8 rights and the exercise of provincial powers, whether legislative, regulatory 
or proprietary. The law requires that provincial powers to govern must be exercised in a way which 
respects Treaty rights and the constitutional as surances which have been given. The ‘taking up’ clause 
in Treaty 8 must be read in the context of its underlying purposes, as intended by both the Crown and 
the First Nation  peoples.35 This includes solemn assurances by the Crown respecting continuity, desp ite 
the change which Treaty 8 presaged, operating with respect to both t he supply of game and fish for 
support and subsistence, and the right to hunt for food. These assurances are solemn constitutional 
obligations to First Nation peoples intended to reconcile their Aboriginal interests with sovereignty, and as such engage the honour of the Crown. The Crown is required to act with diligence in pursuit of 
the fulfillment of these assurances.
36 
17. Weakness in the consultation framework requires judicial action so as to ensure a proper 
appreciation of Treaty rights.  The need for evolution in the law may be illustrated with respect to the 
imminent extirpation of woodland caribou from Alberta ranges, including the traditional lands of Fort McKay.
37 The significance of  woodland caribou to Treaty 8 rights obtained judicial recognition in 
R. v. Horseman ,38 and pending extirpation of this species has never been justified.39 This species would 
not be at risk of extirpation if Treaty 8 rights, as modified by the NRTA,  were pro perly balanced with 
the exercise of provincial and federal powers through the duty to consult as presently applied.  
Weakness in the consultation framework, illustrated by the pending extirpation of a species imprinted 
on the Canadian quarter, flows from ri gid application of the Court ’s statement at paragraph 53 
of Rio Tinto: “[t]he subject of the consultation is the impact on the claimed rights of the current  
decision under consideration.”40 Rigid application of this comment means the duty to consult and 
accommodate is short -sighted, focussing on the trees affected by a government decision rather than on 
the forests in which Treaty 8 rights are exercised and in which game necessary for hunting exist.  When

making this comment the Court was responding to a s ubmission that the duty to consult required, in 
every case, an examination of past  impacts arising from exploitation of the entire resource.41 
By rejecting this submission, the Court was saying that the duty to consult is prospective in nature i.e. 
its purpose is “to take contested or established Aboriginal rights into account before making a decision 
that may have an adverse impact on them.”42 The ironic result of the Court’s comment has been 
overstatement of the capacity of the taking up clause to erode ass urances of continuity of use, and the 
supply of game, through the exercise of provincial powers. The Court did not intend that solemn 
constitutional assurances be eroded to infringement, and then compensated with damages.  
18. The Court has never limited the duty to consult to government decisions, or conduct, which 
have an immediate impact on lands and resources.43 The duty to consult was intended by this Court to 
be a contextual, generative process, extending to strategic decisions.44 Academic commentary points 
out, correctly, that Aboriginal peoples in Alberta are repeatedly frustrated in their efforts to rely upon 
the duty to consult to look forward i.e. to place a current  decision in the context of others in order to 
properly appreci ate the impact on present and future continuity of right which has been assured to 
them.45 Judicial commentary recognizes that a rigid insistence upon examination of adverse impacts at 
the project level does not accurately appreciate future impacts.46 When t his Court spoke of the adverse 
effects of the winter road in Mikisew Cree upon the exercise of Treaty 8 rights, it did so in broad terms 
of injurious affection of surrounding lands arising from fragmentation of wildlife habitat, disruption of migration patterns, loss of vegetation, increased poaching because of easier motor vehicle access to the area and increased wildlife mortality.
47 Nothing in this is rigidly focused upon the immediate footprint 
of the winter road itself.

19. If the Crown is “to take … [Treat y] …rights into account before making a decision that may 
have an adverse impact on them,”48 then it must consider the impact of the contemporary decision on 
the future exercise of Treaty rights at the level of the whole of a First Nation’s traditional terr itory . 
This prevents extinguishment of constitutionally protected First Nation rights by the cuts of hundreds 
or thousands of individual projects, each one found to be individually insignificant and therefore not 
requiring either accommodation or justifica tion.49 The Court’s decision in Mikisew Cree does not 
establish “the Mikisew Test”50 but, rather, acknowledges that “Treaty 8 provides a framework within 
which to manage the continuing changes in land use already foreseen in 1899 and expected, even now, 
to continue well into the future.”51 This flows from the Court’s recognition of the law  of Aboriginal 
consultation as a framework of broad principle, capable of future development by the courts.52 A broad 
vision in the duty to consult supports public policy objectives of sustainable development, defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future gener ations 
to meet their own needs,
53 and the precautionary principle.54 A broad vision will also recognize the 
necessity of effective cooperative federalism, since federal and provincial action will be required to 
protect the supply of fish and game. Provincial powers in relation to land and resources must be 
coordinated with federal powers in relation to inland fisheries, migratory  birds, and species at risk, 
in this respect.  
20. Lack of foresight in the duty to consult and accommodate undermines the assurances of 
continuity given to First Nations by the Numbered Treaties and the NRTAs . Because of the scale and 
extent of industrial development now occurring in the 21st century, more is immediately required in law 
to ensure respect for the assurances given, and obligations undertaken, as a condition of the acquisition 
of land in the Canadian west and derived from the equitable principles which have uniformly governed the relations between Aboriginal persons a nd the British Crown since 1763. Fort McKay therefore 
respectfully submits that the framework of the law of Aboriginal consultation be further developed to
